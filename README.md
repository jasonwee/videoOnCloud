videoOnCloud: storing binary content on cloud.
=============================================

videoOnCloud (or voc) started as a just for fun project to store video on cloud.
However as development continued, we realised we can store beyond just video as
the content is in binary, we can basically store anything on the datastore.

Current supported datastore is cassandra.
