videoOnCloud: storing binary content on cloud.
=============================================

videoOnCloud started as a just for fun project to store video on cloud. 
However as development continue, we realised we can store beyond just video as
the content is in binary, we can basically store anything on the datastore.

Current supported datastore is cassandra.
