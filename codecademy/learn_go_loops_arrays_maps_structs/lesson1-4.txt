Infinite Loops
Sometimes an indefinite loop does not end, creating an infinite loop.

An infinite loop is a loop where the condition can never be reached, causing the loop to run forever.

Sometimes this can be dangerous as it can make a program appear to be frozen to the user. But for something like a web server that constantly needs to be running, these infinite loops are critical.

While an infinite loop can be any loop that does not end, a purposefully created infinite loop is written like this:

for {
  // Loop body logic
  // This repeats forever
}
// This is never reached

There is also a way to stop these loops at a certain point in code, which will be discussed in the next exercise!




package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

var number int

func count() {
  var input int
  fmt.Print("Number of guests: ")
  fmt.Scan(&input)
  number = number + input
  fmt.Println("Total guests:", number)
}

func main() {

  // WRITE THE INFINITE LOOP CONTAINING THE COUNT FUNCTION BELOW
  for {
  count()
  }

}
