1.1.1 Introduction to C++
---------------------------------------
Introduction to C++
C++ is a programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979. Forty years later, it is one of the most widely used languages in the world; we can find C++ applications everywhere, from the bottom of the oceans to the surface of Mars.

As the name implies, C++ was derived from the C language; Bjarne‚Äôs goal was to add object-oriented programming into C, a language well-respected for its portability and low-level functionality.

So why learn C++? Among many other things:

It is fast and flexible.
It is well-supported.
It forces you to think in new and creative ways.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll start learning some basic concepts, and you‚Äôll write your very first C++ program.

Note: Don‚Äôt worry if some words don‚Äôt make much sense right now. We‚Äôll learn about them in a bit!

1.1.2 Hello World!
---------------------------------------
Take a look at the hello.cpp file in the code editor that is placed in the middle of the screen. It‚Äôs a C++ program!

In our code editor, the file name is displayed at the top:

C++ programs are stored in files which usually have the file extension .cpp, which simply stands for ‚ÄúC Plus Plus‚Äù.

The code inside our C++ file is a classic first step all new programmers take ‚Äî they greet the world through the terminal!

The terminal is the black panel on the right. It should be blank right now. The code in the text editor will print text out onto the terminal. More specifically, it will print the phrase Hello World!.

Before we explain what all that mumbo jumbo is, let‚Äôs run the program to see what happens.



1.1.3 Output
---------------------------------------
Output
High five! We just got your first program to run.

C++, like most programming languages, runs line by line, from top to bottom. Here is the structure of a C++ program:

In between the curly braces is what we are going to focus on for now.

std::cout << "Hello World!\n";

std::cout is the ‚Äúcharacter output stream‚Äù. It is pronounced ‚Äúsee-out‚Äù.

<< is an operator that comes right after it.

"Hello World!\n" is what‚Äôs being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.

; is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.



1.1.4 Pattern 
---------------------------------------
Pattern
We learned how to output a line of text with the following code:

std::cout << "üöôüí®\n";
It will output:

üöôüí®
We can also output multiple lines by adding more std::cout statements:

std::cout << "Hello\n";
std::cout << "Goodbye\n";
This will output:

Hello
Goodbye
Now let‚Äôs use what we learned so far to complete a coding challenge!



1.1.5 Review
---------------------------------------
Review
Woohoo! You have written a few C++ programs. üôå

In this lesson, you have learned:

C++ is a general-purpose coding language.
C++ runs line by line, from top to bottom.
std::cout is how you output to the terminal:
std::cout << "Good luck!\n";
