5.1 Lesson Overview
---------------------------------------
Lesson Outline
Reviewing raw logs would be tedious and time consuming. In this lesson, we'll look at how we can use Grafana to create dashboards that allow us to visualize the data we've been collecting with Prometheus and Jaeger, so that we can see the performance of our system and application at a glance.

Starting with dashboards. First, we'll look at how to set up dashboards with Grafana, and we'll learn the key features of the dashboard UI.
Panels. Next, we'll create panels. These are essentially containers for charts and graphs within our dashboards.
Metrics. Then we will discuss how to use the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to track metrics on our cluster, and how to use Jaeger to track metrics on our application.
Edge case: Alternative tools. Finally, we'll look at some alternative tools and learn some of the best practices concerning when we might want to use something other than the Prometheus-Jaeger-Grafana stack for monitoring and observability.



5.2 Starting with Dashboards
---------------------------------------
Starting with Dashboards.
Remember, you can get all of the files you'll need for this and the other exercises in this course from this GitHub Repo.


When setting up Jaeger, we have to create an application and set our deployment to do sidecar injecting. Then we want to port-forward our Grafana service.

In real life, you would likely use NGINX or Istio as a service to expose the service.

NOTE: Your Vagrant machine may have gotten stale. If so, just run vagrant halt and then vagrant up. If vagrant halt fails, it's likely because it was not running.


q1
What is the default HTTP port used to access a Grafana dashboard?
3000


q2
A data source for Jaeger was created in the above video. I needed to point to our Jaeger Query instance. What is the HTTP port and what is the Kubernetes namespace?

(Select two optionsâ€”one for the port and one for the namespace.)
11686
default
