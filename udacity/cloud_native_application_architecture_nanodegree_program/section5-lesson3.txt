3.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
In this lesson, we will focus on verifying the security of a Docker configuration with an open-source tool called Docker-bench, as you would during the build phase of the SDLC. Once verified, we will deploy the image to Docker Hub.

Note: In this lesson, we will test the list of possible threats we established with STRIDE and confirm which threats actually exist by running Docker-bench.



3.2 Lesson Overview
---------------------------------------
In this lesson, we will cover the following topics:

Refresh on Docker attack surfaces from the previous lesson
Evaluate Docker process isolation
Inspect an image with Docker-bench to evaluate attack surface hands-on, identify threats and compare them to our threat model
Sign the image using Docker content trust and commit the hardened Docker image to Docker Hub



3.3 Docker Attack Surface
---------------------------------------
Refresher on Docker Attack Surface
What can go wrong? Let's examine this question for the three top-level groups - Docker client, Docker host, and Docker registry.

Docker client: We are most concerned with the compromise of the Docker desktop running on the administrator's machine, abuse of the client's authorization to make privileged changes, and how the Dockerfile is built.
Docker host also has a large attack surface - we are most concerned with namespace isolation to prevent container escape attacks, insecure defaults, and misconfiguration.
Docker registry likely has the largest attack surface with the most external implications. Here we are concerned with image security, Open-Source Software (OSS) security, and Docker registry security.
Next, letâ€™s take review each top concern (client compromise, isolation tampering, and image security) in more detail.

3.4 Docker Client - Compromise
---------------------------------------
Docker client security is vital because the Docker client is how the user interacts with the Docker host.

What Could Happen with Client Compromise
If the Docker client is compromised, you should assume the attacker has privileged access to the host. At this point, the attacker controls the client and has the ability to control the host using the administrator's privilege access. All the built-in security controls are bypassed.

How the Client Can Be Abused
The machine running the Docker client is often an engineer's machine which often runs in a privileged context. This machine may be compromised via malware which may allow an attacker to control the machine remotely.

How to Protect against Abuse
Hardening the machine running the client (macOS, Windows, or Linux) is a good practice. However, that's beyond the scope of this course. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides hardening guides for all popular operating systems. You should collect and analyze Docker client logs.
Run the latest patched version of the Docker client.
Run anti-virus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) software to detect malicious processes and respond.
Avoid using the --privileged flag when running commands, as this flag makes the container privileged, opening the door to container escape.
New Terms
Endpoint detection and response (EDR) software: An agent that monitors for and alerts to suspicious processes and file system changes. Commercial examples include Crowdstrike Falcon and Carbon Black Response.
