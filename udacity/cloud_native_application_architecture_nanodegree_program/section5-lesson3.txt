3.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
In this lesson, we will focus on verifying the security of a Docker configuration with an open-source tool called Docker-bench, as you would during the build phase of the SDLC. Once verified, we will deploy the image to Docker Hub.

Note: In this lesson, we will test the list of possible threats we established with STRIDE and confirm which threats actually exist by running Docker-bench.



3.2 Lesson Overview
---------------------------------------
In this lesson, we will cover the following topics:

Refresh on Docker attack surfaces from the previous lesson
Evaluate Docker process isolation
Inspect an image with Docker-bench to evaluate attack surface hands-on, identify threats and compare them to our threat model
Sign the image using Docker content trust and commit the hardened Docker image to Docker Hub
