2.1 Introducing Flexbox
---------------------------------------
To use flexbox set the display property of a div to flex. The items inside that element will automatically become flex items, and you can then use the flexbox syntax in your CSS code.



2.2 A Quick Flexbox Example
---------------------------------------
By setting an element's display property to flex, all elements inside of it become flex items that can be laid out in a customized way following design patterns like columns, rows, alignment, and distribution.

QUIZ QUESTION
What do you add to your code to begin using flexbox properties?
By setting the display property of the parent element to flex.

      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      border: 2px solid yellow;
  }
  .box{
        width: 250px;
        height: 150px;
        border: 1px solid red;
    }
  </style>

  <div class = "container">
    <div class="box"> Box 1</div>
    <div class="box"> Box 2</div>

  </div>
  </body>
</html>


Here, we have learned that Flexbox (the Flexible Box Module) is a set of CSS rules for stretching multiple columns or rows across a parent container. Flex is unique amongst CSS properties because you have a main container and the items nested within it. CSS flex has properties that apply to both the element itself, and the items inside of it.

To use flexbox set the display property of the parent container to flex:

.container{
  display:flex;
}

2.3 Axes and Direction with Flexbox
---------------------------------------
The Flexbox model relies on two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:

* row
* row-reverse
* column
* column-reverse

The two row settings will create the main axis horizontally - or inline direction. The two column settings will create the main axis vertically - or block direction. block or inline here refer to the CSS display settings which we have covered previously.

The axis determines the flow of your content - you can think of this as being either rows or columns - and they will be determined when you start aligning and justifying content within a flex container.



2.4 Axes and Direction in Action
---------------------------------------
Axes and Direction in Action
After setting an element's display to flex, the next thing you will usually want to state is whether the elements inside the container should be laid out in rows or columns. You can do this using the flex-direction property, and setting its value to either column or row.

To set the layout of the items in a flex container to either a row or column use the flex-direction property like this:

.container{
  display:flex;
  flex-direction: row
}

QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following are true?
If the flex-direction is set to row or row-reverse the main axis is horizontal.
If the flex-direction is set to column or column-reverse the main axis is vertical.
If the main axis is horizontal the cross axis is vertical.
The two axis control the flow of space in flexbox and correspond to the align-items and justify-content properties.


Axes and direction are important concepts for understanding flexbox. They are both conceptual and technical which can be tricky. One suggestion is to try and draw your flex containers out first in a notebook. This can be helpful for mapping out axes and direction.

2.5 Ordering Elements with Flexbox
---------------------------------------
There are three ways to explicitly set the order in which items will appear in a grid.

1. Moving the HTML code for the elements themselves to reorder
2. Appending -reverse to row or column will reverse the order in the specified row or column
3. Using the order property of the individual items inside the grid



2.6 Ordering Elements Demo
---------------------------------------
Ordering Elements Demo
flex-direction:row; will lay elements out from left to right. But flex-direction:row-reverse will flip that order and display elements from right to left.

The row and columns settings for flex elements can be reversed by appending -reverse to either property value.


QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following is NOT a valid way to order elements inside a grid with Flexbox?
Naming the elements in numeric order



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Exercise 1</title>
    <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" name="viewport"/>
    <!-- Change the order of elements so that box 3 appears first, then box2, then box 1 -->

  <style>
  .container{
    display:flex;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    border: 2px solid yellow;
  }
  .box{
        width: 250px;
        height: 150px;
        border: 1px solid red;
    }
  </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- Change the order of elements so that box 3 appears first, then box2, then box 1 -->

  <div class = "container">
    <div class="box"> Box 1</div>
    <div class="box"> Box 2</div>
    <div class="box"> Box 3</div>
  </div>
  </body>
</html>



Summary
The order of flex items is by default determined by the order they appear in your code. You can explicitly change this order using either -reverse or with the CSS property order.

2.7 Aligning Items & Justifying Content with Flexbox
---------------------------------------
To align items on the cross axis use align-items with the possible values:

* stretch
* flex-start
* flex-end
* center

To justify content on the main axis use justify-content, which has the possible values:

* flex-start
* flex-end
* center
* space-around
* space-between
* space-evenly



2.8 Aligning & Justifying in Action
---------------------------------------
Aligning & Justifying in Action
Aligning, justifying, and distributing is what flexbox is all about. Up next, we will focus in on two of the most powerful properties that flex introduces to achieve such easy and elegant layouts.

By setting different values for the properties align-items and justify-content you can easily create elegant distribution of elements across the available space.

QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following is true?
The align-items property will align the items on the cross axis.

  <style>
    /* Align and justify items in the grid to the center */
  .container{
    display:flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    border: 2px solid yellow;
  }
  .box{
        width: 250px;
        height: 150px;
        border: 1px solid red;
    }
  </style>
  </head>

  <body>

  <div class = "container">
    <div class="box"> Box 1</div>
    <div class="box"> Box 2</div>
    <div class="box"> Box 3</div>
  </div>
  </body>
</html>
