1.2 The Udacity Experience
---------------------------------------
If this is your first Nanodegree program, welcome. If you have taken a Nanodegree program with us before, you already know a little bit of what to expect. Udacity is always improving our learning experience for students. So you can watch this to see what is changed or skip ahead. You can also read this in the FAQ located in the resources tab.

Let’s get started.

We truly believe you couldn’t have chosen a better place to learn. A lot of people have worked tirelessly to create the course material and platform features, as we all want you to get the most of your learning journey. Our pledge is to provide you with resources and services that will further enable you to succeed in your Nanodegree program. As you go through the lessons, you may find some to be difficult and may feel discouraged. If this happens, we encourage you to take advantage of your community channels and mentor services to help clarify the concepts, or just to share your doubts. Our mentors are there to help you! You will get advice and guidance to ensure you are on track to complete the projects. We WANT you to succeed and graduate with a Udacity Nanodegree certificate.

We value the trust you have put in us by making this investment in your future career. We take it seriously and we are here to help you achieve whatever you came here to accomplish.
