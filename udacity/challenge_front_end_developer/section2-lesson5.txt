2.1 Building Layouts with Grid
---------------------------------------
CSS Grid allows you to create simple, elegant and professional quality webpage designs.

￼

2.2 A Simple blog Page
---------------------------------------
A Simple Blog Page
In the following screencast we will build the template for a simple blog webpage that has some dummy links and one real link to a demo page. In the end we will have a layout for a blog homepage and a blog entry itself. Let's dive in!

CSS Grid can be used to setup multiple displays within a single site. In the previous demo we used to CSS Grid to create a blog home page and an individual page for blog posts.

Separate pages within a web app can be stored in the same folder and linked to each other using <a> tags to create links with the name of the file as the target. For example, in a file index.html you could use the following code to link to another file in the same directory named go.html:

<a href="go.html">Go to page</a>

QUIZ QUESTION
You can only use one CSS grid per web project.
False

In the workspace below add a link from the homepage to the individual blog post. Once you have successfully done this, navigate to the blog entry and then customize the style to start to get an idea of what you might want a blog post layout to look like.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Exercise 1</title>
    <meta
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"
      name="viewport"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

  </head>

  <body>
  <div class = "container">
    <div class="header box">Header</div>
    <div class="sidebar box">
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      <!-- Add Link To Blog Here -->
      <a href="blog-post.html">blog</a>
    </div>
    <div class="content box">Content</div>
    <div class="footer box">Footer</div>
  </div>
  </body>
</html>

.container{
    /* Step 1: Set display to grid */
      display:grid;
   /* Step 2: setup rows amd columns */
  grid-template-columns: 300px 300px 300px;
        grid-template-rows: 250px 600px;
   /* Step : setup named grid areas */
  grid-template-areas:
    "hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd"
     "feat feat feat feat feat feat feat feat"
   "main main main main main main main main"
   "ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft";
      border: 2px solid yellow;

  }
  .box{
    width: 100%;
    border: 1px solid red;
    background: #F8FA9D;
    }

  .header{
      /* Set elements grid-area here */
    grid-area: hd;
  }

  .footer{
    /* Set elements grid-area here */
    grid-area: ft;
  }
  .feature{
    /* Set elements grid-area here */
    grid-area: feat;
  }
  .content{
    /* Set elements grid-area here */
    grid-area: main;
  }

In this section we covered linking webpages together, with each page using its own custom CSS Grid layout. But what happens when people actually start using our web blog on different size screens?!?! Up next we'll cover how to get responsive!

2.3 Media Queries
---------------------------------------
While media queries can be used for a variety of things and in a number of ways, we are going to focus on what are called breakpoints, which are the viewport width at which we want our design to change. We then write the code inside that media query, with a set breakpoint, that we want to go into effect only when the viewport width that the app is being viewed on is at least the breakpoint width. Only the CSS that we want to change needs to go here - the original CSS rules will all still apply, and only the new CSS rules written inside the media query will override any pre-existing rules.

Key Term
viewport - the area of the window in which web content can be seen. We use the dimensions of the viewport (usually the width, but sometimes the height) as the basis of our media queries.

For more information about viewport see
* What is a viewport?
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts#what_is_a_viewport
* Using the viewport meta tag to control layout on mobile browsers
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag



2.4 Adding Media Queries in Code
---------------------------------------
Adding Media Queries in Code
Media queries are used to set different style rules for different devices or sized screens. We use breakpoints to set the condition of a media query. The logic is:

@media(feature:value)
Here media features are aspects of the device that our media (website) is being viewed on. The media feature we are most interested in for this lesson is width, which allows us to evaluate the viewport width of the browser and set conditions based on that evaluation. We actually write this feature min-width (or max-width) because width is one of many media features that are range features, which means they can be prefixed with min- or max- to express constraints, which is what we're looking for with our breakpoints! If the constraint of the breakpoint (viewport width being in the range below our breakpoint) is broken (the width is larger than the breakpoint) the new CSS rule takes effect. Here is an example of how that could look in action:

@media(min-width:900px) {
  body{
   background:red;
 }
}

In this example if the viewport width is greater than 900px the background of the webpage would turn red.

Media queries are used to create responsive layouts using breakpoints. Below is an example of the syntax that is used for creating media queries:

@media(min-width:1100px) {
  body{
    font-size: 27px;
  }
}
In the example above, if the browser width of the webpage being viewed is above 1100px wide, then the font-size would become 27px.

Media queries can help change the layout for different screen sizes

QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following is the correct syntax for media queries with a responsive breakpoint?

@media(min-width:800px) {
  .container {
    border: 2px solid blue;
  }
}



2.5 Multiple Breakpoints
---------------------------------------
Multiple Breakpoints
We have seen how to set a breakpoint and use Media Queries to create different layouts for smaller screens and larger screens, but there are some development moments that will call for 3 possible layouts.

A simple example would be creating 2 different breakpoints so that up to x width one set of CSS rules apply, then between x and y width a second set would apply, and then for anything beyond a width of y a third set of CSS rules would apply.

Here is an example of what that code could look like:

/* Anything smaller than first breakpoint 600px */
.container {
  // rules for small screen
}

/* Medium Screens */
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width:900px) {
  .container {
    // rules for medium-sized screen
  }
}

/* Large Screens */
@media (min-width:901px) {
  .container {
    // rules for large screen
  }
}

In this example, the medium screens media query is new, and we use the keyword and to build a complex media query that evaluates both a min and max to create a range for the CSS rules to apply, in this case if the width of the viewport is between 600px-900px.

/* Mobile first */
.container{
  display:grid;
  grid-template-columns: 300px 300px 300px;
  grid-template-rows: 250px 600px;
  border: 2px solid yellow;
    /* Use grid-template-area to create a mobile layout where each named space occupies its own row */
  grid-template-areas:
    "hd"
    "sd"
    "main"
    "ft";
}
.box{
    border: 1px solid red;
    background: #F8FA9D;
    }

  .header{
    grid-area:hd;
  }
  .footer{
    grid-area: ft;
  }
  .sidebar{
    grid-area: sd;
  }
  .content{
    grid-area: main;
  }

/* If Screen Is Wide Enough */
@media(min-width:900px){
.container{
      display:grid;
      grid-template-columns: 300px 300px 300px;
      grid-template-rows: 250px 600px;
      grid-template-areas:
      "hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd"
      "sd sd main main main main main main"
      "ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft";
      border: 2px solid red;
  }
}



/* Mobile First Layout */
.container{
      display:grid;
      grid-template-columns: 300px 300px 300px;
      grid-template-rows: 250px 600px;
      border: 2px solid yellow;
    /* Use grid-template-area to create a mobile layout where each named space occupies its own row */
      grid-template-areas:
    "hd"
    "sd"
    "main"
    "ft";
    border: 5px solid aquamarine;

  }
  .box{
    border: 1px solid red;
    background: #F8FA9D;
    }

  .header{
      grid-area:hd;
  }

  .footer{
    grid-area: ft;
  }
  .feature{
    grid-area: feat;
  }
  .content{
    grid-area: main;
  }

  /* If wide enough */
  @media(min-width:900px){
    .container{
      display:grid;
      grid-template-columns: 300px 300px 300px;
      grid-template-rows: 250px 600px;
      grid-template-areas:
      "hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd"
      "feat feat feat feat feat feat feat feat"
      "main main main main main main main main"
      "ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft";
      border: 2px solid yellow;
  }
}

Complex media queries can be built using the keyword and to bound CSS rules between a range using min-width and max-width.

Further Research
Media Queries are actually a vast landscape of possibility, most of which you will probably never use - but, having a strong grasp of media queries and responsive breakpoints is essential for a web developer. For more information see the MDN docs entry on using Media Queries.

2.6 Building Responsive Layouts with Flexbox & Grid
---------------------------------------
One of the most useful features of CSS grid is that you can easily nest grids inside each other to create elegant, complex layouts. To nest CSS grids simply set the display property of the container element to grid and then select the child grid item you want to make the nested grid and set the display property of that element to grid as well! The same grid rules you’ve been learning still apply! Easy as that!

￼


2.7 Nesting Grids in Practice
---------------------------------------
Nesting Grids in Practice
In the screencast below you’ll see how nesting grids works in practice, and how a nested grid can be used to make a simple image gallery.

Nesting CSS grids is simple and can be done simply by using the display:grid rule for both a parent and child element.

Here is how that could look with real code:

.container {
  display:grid;
  // ...
}

#one {
  display:grid
}
