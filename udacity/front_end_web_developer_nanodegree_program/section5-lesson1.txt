5.1.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
Welcome to part four of the front end development course!
You have learned to build a webpage with HTML and CSS, and to make it interactive with Javascript. You have all the tools you need to make a fully functional website - and that’s awesome! But you might be asking - where do I go from here? In this course we are going to cover some tools that will take your front end web development skills to a professional level. We will focus on a build tool called Webpack and let it take us on a tour through all the most common technologies and strategies you’ll see in a professional front end project.

This course is really about a mental shift. Up to this point we have built toy apps for the purpose of learning that typically only have one user - us. But how does our development need to change in order to build, say, a large company website with a whole team of devs? We’re going to explore that and a whole lot more in the coming modules.

Lesson Objectives
The prime objectives of this first lesson are:

1. To set up the context of why we need build-tools for front end development.
2. To understand how any build tool uses a configuration file where all the app development rules are defined.

Baseline Questions
Have you ever used build tools in a project?
yes, many, from ant, maven, gradle, make and npm

Baseline Questions
As you start this course, what is your current understanding of build tools (if any)? What are they? What are they for/what do they do?
allow quickly to run compile , to test and build final binary files in a single command.

Baseline Questions
As you start this course, what is your current understanding of Webpack (if any)? Feel free to throw out even bits and pieces if you can't think of a full description. Things like where is Webpack used, what it does, other technologies that use it, etc..
in npm, when install package, npm provide a means to find,  install and update its config file , provide dependencies solution and many more.

Interview Question
Tell me about one tool you have used that improved your frontend workflow and why. This could be anything from a text editor plugin, linter, time tracker, etc... whatever you like.
i would say the devtools that comes with the browser is a must to use... it contain all tools to identify the problem during frontend development.
