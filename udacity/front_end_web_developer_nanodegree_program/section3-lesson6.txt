3.6.1 Project Introduction
---------------------------------------
Project Summary
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

What You Will Build
You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work. You’ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you find this process to be quick, there’s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve the users’ experience.

What will I learn?
The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:

* What’s the ideal workflow?
* How many files do I need?
* Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
* How many JavaScript functions do I need?
* Should my function be this many lines of code?
* Is readability or performance more important?

There’s no single correct answer to each question. While building this project, working with peers, and getting feedback from the project reviewer -- you will naturally develop your own answers to these questions!


3.6.2 Getting Started
---------------------------------------
Getting Started

Introduction
This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

Project Rubric
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Landing Page project rubric. Please review for detailed project requirements.

Get the Starter Code
If you'd like to start from scratch without any files, you are encouraged to do so! You learn the most by developing on your own! But, it can be a bit challenging having to start from scratch, so we do provide a starter project (i.e., a "skeleton") to use.

You can download the starter code here by cloning the specific branch 'refresh-2019'.

The starter code has a static, non-interactive version of the project so you can get a jump-start on development!

JavaScript and the DOM
Great! You now have the starter code. Before moving forward, make sure you are comfortable with the content from the JavaScript and the DOM course. Ask yourself:

* What is the Document?
* What are events?
 * How do we listen for them?
 * How does event delegation help us avoid too many events?
 * Check Working with Browser Events in JavaScript and the DOM for a refresher if needed
* How can we access elements with the following two methods? What are the differences between them?
 * querySelector()
 * querySelectorAll()
* How do you use getElementbyId() to select a DOM element by its id?
* We can also access elements with getElementsByClassName(). What does this method return, and how do you use it?
* How do you use the className property? What does it return, and why would it be useful?
* What are the different methods for classList?
 * Hint: the add(), remove(), and toggle() methods look particularly useful...
* Every element has an innerHTML property that represents the markup of the element's content. How can you leverage this property to get and set content?


3.6.3 Development Strategy
---------------------------------------
Development Strategy
For this project, you will be writing most of your code in js/app.js. Note that it's very important that you plan your project before you start writing any code! Break your project down into small pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.

Feel free to implement your own design workflow, but if you get stuck -- here is a walkthrough to get you up and running!

Rubric Tip: All the points mentioned below will help you to satisfy the criteria for the project rubric. Please make sure to re-review the rubric for detailed project requirements prior to submission.

1. Start by linking your app.js. where should this file go based on your present knowledge? We’ll test some other locations later.
2. Build out your HTML and at least 4 content sections. The rest of your functionality relies on these sections.
* Take a quick look at all the HTML elements in index.html. Note the values for their id, class, and data attributes. To manipulate the DOM, you'll be using many of the tools and methods you've learned on these elements (and on those that you will create).
 * For a refresher on the data attribute, visit here.
* Which data structure can you use to store these sections? This data structure can represent all sections for your page, so it might be a good idea to save it to a variable.
* How you would iterate (i.e., loop) over this data structure?
* Think about how you can create, say, an unordered list (i.e., bulleted list) in HTML from this structure, and where you be placing that list.
* Think about how you’ll test whether a section is in the viewport.
* What actions are you performing that will cause interactivity with the DOM?
3. Build the navigation menu. This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page. This can be a particularly useful trick when you begin working with content management systems or APIs when you are uncertain of where the items will be.
* Are you listening for an event for the navigation to build?
* Where are you placing the navigation?
* Where is the text for each navigation item coming from and where are you anchoring to?
* How are you going to add each navigation item to your menu? (Hint: there are several ways to do this. Do some research to figure out which makes the most sense for your situation. Performance? Clarity?).
4. Add functionality to distinguish the section in view. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.
* Are you listening for an event for sections to become active?
* How are you going to test which section should be highlighted?
* How can we use classList methods to change the CSS being displayed? What about removing that CSS?
* Check the HTML and CSS files to ensure that what you chose is updated in the other locations.
5. Add the functionality to scroll to sections. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.
* Which event are you listening for (hint: you were just reading it)?
* There is a default event occurring that we need to stop. How?
* If you don’t recall how HTML page anchors work, read more to figure out which variables you should set.
* There are several javascript methods for scrolling. Which seems like it may be the most simple?
6. REFACTOR. At this point, your code should be working properly. Ideally, refactoring happens while you are developing, but as a new developer, you often don’t have the whole picture in your head to be able to do so properly. Let’s clean the project up.
* Have you run your code through a linter? We request you still follow Udacity standards when the code is complete, but running it through an eslinter is going to help you get started in refactoring.
* Are you using ES6 const and let?
* Are all your functions using ES6 arrow functions?
* Is your code DRY? Are there any pieces that would be better served as a helper function to avoid duplication?
* How is your code structured? Have you created functions for the main functionality with properly scoped variables? Starting out it’s likely that you will have a globally scoped variables on occasion until you learn more about closures and design patterns. But placing your code into functions is a great way to make your code more readable and a way to avoid globally scoped variables.
* Are you using the best method for your iterations?
7. Add additional sections to your HTML document. See how the navigation builds.
8. Test the performance. The performance of your page can be affected by how you write your javascript as well as where you load your javascript.
 * Test loading the javascript in the head vs at the end of the body. What issues arise? Is there a way to still load in the head without breaking the page? What is the performance like compared to loading at the end of the body?
9. Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
* Detect the element location relative to the viewport using .getBoundingClientRect() built-in function.
* Set CSS class active state when the element is in the viewport.
* Hint: see this Knowledge post to implement this functionality.
10. Suggested:
* Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
* Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
* Add a scroll to the top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
* Update/change the design/content.
* Make sections collapsible.
11. Responsive landing page:
* A Responsive layout of the landing page should be created to use across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.
* Make sure that the navigation bar is responsive too across all these devices.
* Responsiveness can be verified by inspecting the landing page using the Developer Tools option on Google Chrome Browser.
12. Comments:
 * The project should be properly commented.
 * Comments should be present at the beginning of each procedure and class.
 * Great to have comments before crucial code sections within the procedure.
13. README:
 * The README file in the starter code should replace the given texts with the specific information of this project.
 * It doesn’t have to be thorough but should have some basic information, e.g. project description, usage, dependencies
 * The markdown syntax should be used correctly in this file.
 * References: markdown guide and example of README contents
Version Control
Although not a requirement, we recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our Git Style Guide.
Udacity Style Guides
You should write your code and markup to meet the specifications provided in these style guides:
* CSS Style Guide
* HTML Style Guide
* JavaScript Style Guide
* Git Style Guide
Still Not Sure How to Begin?
To reiterate, be sure that you are comfortable with the content from JavaScript and the DOM. After all, this entire project is about DOM manipulation!

A note on plagiarism: Viewing someone else’s code to get a general idea of implementation, then putting it away and starting to write your own code from scratch is okay. Please do not copy someone's code, in whole or in part. For further details, check out this guide regarding plagiarism.
