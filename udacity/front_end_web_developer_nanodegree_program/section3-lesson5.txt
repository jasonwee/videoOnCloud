---------------------------------------



3.5.2 Add Page Content Efficiently
---------------------------------------
Using A Loop To Add Content

In the last lesson, we used a for loop to create two hundred paragraphs, add event listeners to them, and add them to the page. Let's take another look at the for loop, but this time without all of the event listener stuff:

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    document.body.appendChild(newElement);
}

Let's quickly recap the code to see where we can make improvements.

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    document.body.appendChild(newElement);
}

This code:

* creates a paragraph element
* adds some text to the paragraph
* adds the paragraph to the page

...and it does this two hundred times.

Since we want two hundred things done, the best way to do this is with a for loop, so that code is inescapable. However, the code inside the for loop is not all that efficient, and there are quite a few things we could do to improve this code. We could:

* create some parent container element outside of the loop
* we could append all new paragraph elements to this parent container
* we append this parent container to the <body> element instead of appending each time through the loop

Let's see all of these changes:

const myCustomDiv = document.createElement('div');

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
  const newElement = document.createElement('p');
  newElement.innerText = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

  myCustomDiv.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(myCustomDiv);

This looks a lot better, right? Right!...but how do we know it is? How can we prove it's better?

We can test the time it takes to actually run this code!

Testing Code Performance
The standard way to measure how long it takes code to run is by using performance.now(). performance.now() returns a timestamp that is measured in milliseconds, so it's extremely accurate. How accurate? Here's what the its documentation page says:

accurate to five thousandths of a millisecond (5 microseconds)

That's incredibly precise!

If you've ever used a timing procedure in another programming language, then you might've heard of Epoch time (also called Unix time or POSIX time). These tools tell you the time that has passed since 1/1/1970 (the first of January). The browser's performance.now() method is slightly different in that it starts measuring from the time the page loaded. Detailed information can be found on its documentation page: performance.now() on MDN

These are the steps to use performance.now() to measure the speed of your code:

1. use performance.now() to get the initial start time for the code
* run the code you want to test
* execute performance.now() to get another time measurement
* subtract the initial time from the final time

Adding two hundred paragraphs to the page is actually going to be relatively quick, so let's slow things down by using a set of nested for loops that just count from one to a hundred...one hundred times!

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { 
  for (let j = 1; j <= 100; j++) {
    console.log('i and j are ', i, j);
  }
}

Next, we'll add in the performance.now() code to measure how long these loops take:

const startingTime = performance.now();

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { 
  for (let j = 1; j <= 100; j++) {
    console.log('i and j are ', i, j);
  }
}

const endingTime = performance.now();
console.log('This code took ' + (endingTime - startingTime) + ' milliseconds.');

Let's go back to our original code of adding two hundred paragraphs to the page to see how long that code takes to run.

Using a Document Fragment

So far, we've made a number of improvements to the code. However, there is still one thing that seems not so great; we have to create a extraneous <div> element just to hold all the <p> tags so we can add them all at once and then we append this <div> to the <body> element. So in the end, we have an extra <div> that isn't really needed. It was just around because we wanted to add each new <p> to it instead of to the <body>.

Why are we doing this? The browser is constantly working to make the screen match the DOM. When we add a new element, the browser has to run through a reflow calculation (to determine the new screen layout) and then repaint the screen. This takes time.

If we had added each new paragraph to the body element, then the code would've been a lot slower, because this would cause the browser to go through the reflow and repaint process for each paragraph. We really only want the browser to do this once, so we need to attach each new paragraph to something, but we don't want to have an extra, unneeded element to get added to the DOM.

This is exactly why we have the DocumentFragment! According to the documentation, a DocumentFragment:

represents a minimal document object that has no parent. It is used as a lightweight version of Document that stores a segment of a document structure comprised of nodes just like a standard document.

So it's like creating another lightweight DOM tree. But the beneficial part of this is what it says next:

The key difference is that because the document fragment isn't part of the active document tree structure, changes made to the fragment don't affect the document, cause reflow, or incur any performance impact that can occur when changes are made.

In other words, changes made to a DocumentFragment happen off-screen; there's no reflow and repaint cost while you build this. So this is exactly what we need!

We can use the .createDocumentFragment() method to create an empty DocumentFragment object. This code should be very familiar to you, because it looks so very similar to document.createElement().

const myDocFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();

Let's rewrite our code to use a DocumentFragment instead of the <div>.

const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();  // ← uses a DocumentFragment instead of a <div>

for (let i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.innerText = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    fragment.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(fragment); // reflow and repaint here -- once!

Recap

In this section, we took a brief dive into the performance implications of the code we write. We looked at a specific chunk of code and came up with ways that we could improve its performance simply by rearranging when the code was running (moving initialization code out of the for loop).

We also looked at how to measure how long it takes code to run using performance.now().

Lastly, we looked at using a DocumentFragment to prevent performance issues and to prevent adding unnecessary elements to the DOM.

3.5.3 Reflow & Repaint
---------------------------------------
Reflow & Repaint
We mentioned Reflow and Repaint in the last section, now it's time to take a closer look.

Reflow is the process of the browser laying out the page. It happens when you first display the DOM (generally after the DOM and CSS have been loaded), and happens again every time something could change the layout. This is a fairly expensive (slow) process.

Repaint happens after reflow as the browser draws the new layout to the screen. This is fairly quick, but you still want to limit how often it happens.

For example, if you add a CSS class to an element, the browser often recalculates the layout of the entire page—that's one reflow and one repaint!

Reflect
Adding a single CSS class could trigger reflow. In your own words, explain why adding some CSS to an element might cause reflow to happen.

because single css change direct change all the document layout thus a reflow process happen.

Why did adding a little CSS change cause a reflow? What if adding a class changed the position of the element or caused it to float? The browser won't know for certain (and a complete calculation of the impact of a change could take longer than doing the reflow!)

Let's take a realistic example. Say you're writing the next great blogging platform, and you want to have a "remove spam" button for the administrator. Your HTML looks like this:

<div id="comments">
  <div class="comment"> <!-- some content --> </div>
  <div class="comment"> <!-- some content --> </div>
  <div class="comment"> <!-- some content --> </div>
</div>

When we run the spam filter, we discover comments one and two have to be removed.

If we simply call .removeChild() for each of the two comments that need to be removed, that's one reflow and one repaint for each change (so a total of 2 reflows and 2 repaints). We could rebuild the whole thing in a DocumentFragment and replace #comments -- that's the time to rebuild (possibly involving reading files or data), plus at least one reflow and one repaint.

Or we could hide #comments, delete the spam, and show it again -- that's surprisingly fast, to the cost of one reflow and two repaints (and little else). It's fast because hiding doesn't change the layout, it just erases that section of the screen (1 repaint). When you make the changed section visible again, that's a reflow and a repaint.

// hide #comments
document.getElementById("comments").style.display = "none";

// delete spam comments

// show #comments
document.getElementById("comments").style.display = "block";

In general, if you have to make a group of changes, hide/change all/show is a great pattern to use if the changes are relatively contained.

Virtual DOM
By the way, this is why React and other "virtual DOM" libraries are so popular. You don't make changes to the DOM, but make changes to another structure (a "virtual DOM") and the library calculates the best way to update the screen to match. The catch is you then have to rework your code to use whatever library you're adopting, and sometimes you can do a better job updating the screen yourself (because you understand your own unique situation).

Recap
In this section, we took a brief look at what reflow and repaint are and saw how they can impact the performance of a website.

Reflow is the process of calculating the dimensions and position of page elements. This is a computationally intensive (slow) tasks. Repaint is the process of drawing the pixels to the screen. This is faster than reflow, but is still not a fast process. You want to make sure that your code causes the fewest number of reflows as possible.

3.5.4 The Call Stack
---------------------------------------
Single Threading
You might've heard that JavaScript is single-threaded but what does that mean? According to Wikipedia, single-threading is:

the processing of one command at a time (source)

Ok, so JavaScript can "process" one command at a time. The opposite of single-threading, is multithreading. There are numerous pros and cons to both which we won't be getting into (feel free to check out the Wikipedia article on Threading for more info about the pros and cons). We're going to take a look at JavaScript's single-threaded model and how/why we should write our code to take advantage of it.

Let's look at some code:

function addParagraph() {
    const para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = 'JavaScript is single threaded!';
    document.body.appendChild(para);
}

function appendNewMessage() {
    const para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = "Isn't that cool?";
    document.body.appendChild(para);
}

addParagraph();
appendNewMessage();

Keeping JavaScript's single-threaded nature in mind (meaning it can only perform one task at a time), let's break down this code into the order it will run:

* the addParagraph() function is declared on line 1
* the appendNewMessage() function is declared on line 6
* addParagraph() is called on line 13
 * execution moves into the function and executes all three lines in order
 * now that the function is finished, execution returns to where it was called
* the appendNewMessage() function is called on line 14
 * execution moves into the function and executes all three lines in order
 * now that the function is finished, execution returns to where it was called
* the program ends because all lines of code have been executed

Hopefully, the order that this code executed in wasn't surprising. There are a couple of things I particularly want you to pay attention to. First, is the run-to-completion nature of the code. When addParagraph() is invoked on line 13, all of the code in the function gets executed: it doesn't just execute some lines and leave other lines to be executed later. The entire block of code is run. A second thing I want to point out is that addParagraph() is invoked, runs, and finishes before appendNewMessage() is invoked (including a possible reflow and repaint); JavaScript doesn't execute multiple lines/functions at the same time (this is single-threading...processing one command at a time!).

I have a question for you - once addParagraph() has been invoked and it runs the lines of code inside the addParagraph() function, how does it know to go back to appendNewMessage()? How does it keep track of that?

What if we changed this code slightly to create nested functions:

function addParagraph() {
    const para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = 'JavaScript is single threaded!';

    appendNewMessage();
    document.body.appendChild(para);
}

function appendNewMessage() {
    const para = document.createElement('p');

    para.textContent = "Isn't that cool?";
    document.body.appendChild(para);
}

addParagraph();

Notice that the call to appendNewMessage() is located inside the addParagraph() function. First, addParagraph() is invoked. Then appendNewMessage() is invoked on line 5. Once appendNewMessage() has finished running, execution returns and finishes running the last line of code in the addParagraph() function...but how does it know how to do that? How does the JavaScript engine know where it left off and how to get back to it?

The Call Stack
The JavaScript engine keeps a call stack (basically a list) of the functions that are running. When a function is invoked, it is added to the list. When all of the code inside a function has been run, then the function is removed from the call stack. The cool part about a call stack is that a function doesn't have to complete before another function is added to the call stack.

Let's see how this works!

Quiz Question
￼
How many items (frames) will be on the stack when the code reaches the "stop here" comment?

function quiz () {
  var y = 'yes';
  questions();
  fun();
}
function questions () {
  var y = 'no';
  return 7;
}
function are () {
  return 3;
}
function fun () {
  are();
  // stop here
}

quiz()
Assume there is no "<main>"/default frame.
2

Use this code for the following question.

function dolphins () {
  // stop here
  return 'llamas';
}
function rhinos () {
  var y = 'no';
  return penguins();
}
function penguins () {
  return camels();
}
function camels () {
  return dolphins();
}

rhinos()

Quiz Question
Put the function names in the correct order they would appear when the // stop here comment is reached. Remember to put the oldest/initial at the bottom of the stack. Assume there is no "<main>"/default frame.

These are the correct matches.

Order of Stack         Function Name
Top of the stack       dolphins
2nd item in the stack  camels
3rd item in the stack  penguins
bottom of the stack    rhinos

The Call Stack Recap
In this section, we looked at how JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it can only execute one thing at a time. We looked at how JavaScript keeps track of what functions are running by using the Call Stack.

3.5.5 The Event Loop
---------------------------------------
Code Synchronicity
In the previous section on the Call Stack, we used the terms:

* run-to-completion
* single-threaded

Another term for this is synchronous. By definition, "synchronous" means:

existing or occurring at the same time

All of the code we've been looking at runs in order, at the same time. Functions are added to the call stack, and then removed from the call stack when they've completed. However, there is some code that is not synchronous - meaning that the code is written just like any other code, but it is executed at some later point in time. Does this sound familiar at all? You've just been working with it:

const links = document.querySelectorAll('input');
const thirdField = links[2];

thirdField.addEventListener('keypress', function handleKeyPresses(event) {
    console.log('a key was pressed');
});

...event listeners! Most of this code is synchronous like you're used to. But the event listener's function handleKeyPresses is not invoked immediately, it's invoked at some later point in time.

Have you ever wondered about that? Where does the code go? What about the "call stack" that we learned about? Is it hidden in the call stack somewhere?

Let's look at this code snippet:

console.log('howdy');
document.addEventListener('click', function numbers() {
    console.log('123');
});
console.log('ice cream is tasty');

The code will run in this order:

1. 'howdy' will be logged to the console
* 'ice cream is tasty' will be logged to the console

The string '123' will only be logged if there's a click. If the page is never clicked, then this code might not ever run! But where is it? Where did the numbers function holding the console.log('123'); code go?

Running Code Later
But the same questions exist for this code as it does for the .addEventListener() code:

* where does the function go to wait?
* how does the function get run when it needs to?

This happens because of the JavaScript Event Loop!

The JavaScript Event Loop
The simplest explanation of JavaScript's concurrency model uses two rules: If some JavaScript is running, let it run until it is finished ("run-to-completion"). If no JavaScript is running, run any pending event handlers.

Since most JavaScript is run in response to an event, this is known as an event loop: Pick up the next event, run its handler, and repeat.

There are three parts you have to think about around the event loop:

* the Call Stack
* Web APIs/the browser
* an Event Queue

Not all of the code that we write is 100% JavaScript code. Some of the code is interacting with the Web APIs (also known as "browser APIs"). There are many more examples, but both .addEventListener() and setTimeout() are Web APIs.

Let's look back at this code:

console.log('howdy'); // 1
document.addEventListener('click', // 2
  function numbers() {
    console.log('123');
});
console.log('ice cream is tasty'); // 3

First, the browser runs this block of code to completion -- that is, steps 1, 2, and 3. Step 2 passes an event handler (numbers) to the browser for future use: the browser will hold this function until there's a click event.

What happens if someone clicks before this block of code is done? When there is a click event and there is code already running, the numbers function can't just be added directly to the Call Stack because of JavaScript's run-to-completion nature; we can't interrupt any code that might currently be happening. So the function is placed in the Queue. When all of the functions in the Call Stack have finished (also known as idle time), then the Queue is checked to see if anything is waiting. If something is in the Queue, then it's run, creating an entry on the call stack.

IMPORTANT: The key things to remember here are 1) current synchronous code runs to completion, and 2) events are processed when the browser isn't busy. Asynchronous code (such as loading an image) runs outside of this loop and sends an event when it is done.

Quiz Question
What is the order that the iceCream function goes through if the <footer> is clicked?

const pageFooter = document.querySelector('#page-footer');

pageFooter.addEventListener('click', function iceCream () {
    const footerDetails = document.querySelector('#details');

    footerDetails.textContent = 'Everyone should eat ice cream!';
});

These are the correct matches.

Order    Event Loop Location
First    Browser
Second   the Queue
Third    the Call Stack

Recap

This section uncovered how JavaScript works under the hood; We looked at how JavaScript, the DOM, and Web APIs all fit together.

Specifically, we looked at how JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it can only execute one thing at a time. We looked at how JavaScript keeps track of what functions are running by using the Call Stack. We also looked at how asynchronous code is handled.

Asynchronous code makes use of the JavaScript Event Loop. Any asynchronous code (like setTimeout or the function passed to .addEventListener()) is handled by the browser. When this asynchronous code is ready to be executed, it's moved to the queue where it waits until the Call Stack is empty. Whenever the Call Stack is empty, code moves from the Queue over to the Call Stack and gets executed.

Knowing how JavaScript and the Event Loop work can help us write code that is more efficient.

3.5.6 setTimeout
---------------------------------------
Running Code Later
Similarly to .addEventListener() code being run at some later point, there is the setTimeout() function that will run code at a point later in time. The setTimeout() function takes:

* a function to run at some later time
* the number of milliseconds the code should wait before running the function

Let's check out an example:

setTimeout(function sayHi() {
    console.log('Howdy');
}, 1000);

If we ran this code, the string 'Howdy' would appear in the console in about 1,000 milliseconds or in just about 1 second.

Since setTimeout() is an API provided by the browser, the call to setTimeout() gives the sayHi() function over to the browser which it starts a timer. After the timer is finished, the sayHi() function moves to the Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, then the sayHi() function is moved to the Call Stack and executed.

setTimeout() with Delay of 0
An interesting aspect to setTimeout() is that we can pass it a delay of 0 milliseconds.

setTimeout(function sayHi() {
    console.log('Howdy');
}, 0);  // ← 0 milliseconds!

You might think that since it has a delay of 0 milliseconds, that the sayHi function would run immediately. However, it still goes through the JavaScript Event Loop. So the function is handed off to the browser where the browser starts a timer for 0 milliseconds. Since the timer ends immediately, the sayHi function will move to the Queue, and then to the Call Stack once the Call Stack has finished executing any currently-running tasks.

So why is this helpful? Well, this technique can help us to convert potentially long-running code to one that's broken up to allow for the browser to handle user interactions!

Break Up Long-Running Code
Do you remember back to a previous section when we wrote JavaScript code to add two hundred paragraphs to the page? Now, instead of adding two hundred paragraphs to the page, what if we added twenty thousand? That's a lot of elements to create, append, and insert into the page!

Now keep in mind how reflow and repaint affect an app's performance. We want to write our JavaScript code to take into consideration reflow and repaint and to cause the fewest number of these.

However, we also want to make sure our app is responsive to user interaction. While JavaScript is running, the page is "busy" and the user won't be able to interact with the page (e.g. clicking a button, filling out a form). Remember that this is because JavaScript runs synchronously. So it will run to completion (creating, appending, and inserting all twenty thousand elements), and it does this before it is able to respond to any actions the user has taken. The function that creates all of these elements and adds them to the page will be in the Call Stack until it's completely finished.

One way to give the user a chance to interact with the page is to break up the adding of the content into chunks. Let's do this with setTimeout():

let count = 1

function generateParagraphs() {
    const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();

    for (let i = 1; i <= 500; i++) {
        const newElement = document.createElement('p');
        newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + count;
        count = count + 1;

        fragment.appendChild(newElement);
    }

    document.body.appendChild(fragment);

    if (count < 20000) {
        setTimeout(generateParagraphs, 0);
    }
}

generateParagraphs();

This code starts off by setting a count variable to 1. This will keep track of the number of paragraphs that have been added. The generateParagraphs() function will add 500 paragraphs to the page each time it's invoked. The interesting thing is that there's a setTimeout() call at the end of the generateParagraphs() function. If there are less than twenty thousand elements, then the setTimeout() will be used to call the generateParagraphs() function.

If you try running this code on a page, you can still interact with the page while the code is running. It doesn't lock up or freeze the page. And it doesn't lock up or freeze because of the setTimeout() calls.

setTimeout() Recap

The browser-provided setTimeout() function takes another function and a delay, and invokes the function after the delay has passed.

Knowing how the JavaScript Event Loop works, we can use the setTimeout() method to help us write code that allows the browser to handle user interactions.
