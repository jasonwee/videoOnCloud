3.4.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------

Lesson Overview
To recap, we'll be looking at :

* Events - what they are
* Responding to an event - how to listen for an event and respond when one happens
* Event Data - harness the data that is included with an event
* Stopping an event - preventing an event from triggering multiple responses
* Event Lifecycle - the lifecycle stages of an event
* DOM Readiness - events to know when the DOM itself is ready to be interacted with

This lesson is chock full of incredibly useful information, so don't skim over anything!

Seeing An Event
There is a hidden world of events going on right now on this very page! It's really hard to actually see into this hidden world, though. So how can we know that events really are being announced? If they are being announced, how come they're not easy for us to see?

Fortunately, the Chrome browser has a special monitorEvents() function that will let us see different events as they are occurring.

Check out the documentation on the Chrome DevTools site: monitorEvents documentation

In this video, you saw the following events:

* click
* dblclick
* scroll
* resize

However, there are hundreds more!

The monitorEvents function will keep spitting out all of the events that are happening on the targeted element until the end of time...that, or until you refresh the page. Alternatively, the Chrome browser does offer an unmonitorEvents() function that will turn off the announcing of events for the targeted element:

// start displaying all events on the document object
monitorEvents(document);

// turn off the displaying of all events on the document object.
unmonitorEvents(document);

One last little bit of info on monitorEvents is that this is for development/testing purposes only. It's not supposed to be used for production code.



3.4.2 Respond to Events
---------------------------------------
An Event Target
Do you remember the Node Interface and the Element interface from the first lesson? Do you remember how the Element Interface is a descendant of the Node Interface, and therefore inherits all of Node's properties and methods?

Well there was one piece that I totally skipped over then but am addressing now. The Node Interface inherits from the EventTarget Interface.

The EventTarget page says that EventTarget:

is an interface implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them.

and

Element, document, and window are the most common event targets, but other objects can be event targets too…

As you can see from the image above, the EventTarget is at the top of the chain. This means that it does not inherit any properties or methods from any other interfaces. However, every other interface inherits from it and therefore contain its properties and methods. This means that each of the following is an "event target";

* the document object
* a paragraph element
* a video element
* etc.

Remember that both the document object and any DOM element can be an event target. And again, why is this?...because both the Element Interface and the Document Interface inherit from the EventTarget Interface. So any individual element inherits from the Element Interface, which in turn inherits from the EventTarget Interface. Likewise, the document object comes from the Document Interface, which in turn inherits from the EventTarget Interface.

If you take a look at the EventTarget Interface, you'll notice that it doesn't have any properties and only three methods! These methods are:

* .addEventListener()
* .removeEventListener()
* .dispatchEvent()

The one that we'll be looking at for the rest of this course will be the .addEventListener() method.

Adding An Event Listener
We've taken a brief look at this hidden world of events. Using the .addEventListener() method will let us listen for events and respond to them! I just said "listen for events". There are several ways to "phrase" this, so I want to give some examples:

* listen for an event
* listen to an event
* hook into an event
* respond to an event

...all of these mean the same thing and are interchangeable with one another.

Let's use some pseudo-code to explain how to set an event listener:

<event-target>.addEventListener(<event-to-listen-for>, <function-to-run-when-an-event-happens>);

So an event listener needs three things:

1. an event target - this is called the target
* the type of event to listen for - this is called the type
* a function to run when the event occurs - this is called the listener

The <event-target> (i.e. the target) goes right back to what we just looked at: everything on the web is an event target (e.g. the document object, a <p> element, etc.).

The <event-to-listen-for> (i.e. the type) is the event we want to respond to. It could be a click, a double click, the pressing of a key on the keyboard, the scrolling of the mouse wheel, the submitting of a form...the list goes on!

The <function-to-run-when-an-event-happens> (i.e. the listener) is a function to run when the event actually occurs.

Let's transform the pseudo-code to a real example of an event listener:

const mainHeading = document.querySelector('h1');

mainHeading.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('The heading was clicked!');
});

Let's break down the snippet above:

* the target is the first <h1> element on the page
* the event type to listen for is a "click" event
* the listener is a function that logs "The heading was clicked!" to the console

Check out the documentation for more info: addEventListener docs

Quiz Question
￼
In the following code, what is the event type?

const lotsOfElements = document.querySelectorAll('.quizzing-quizzby');
const element = lotsOfElements[2];

element.addEventListener('animationend', function () {
    const mainHeading = document.querySelector('h1');

    mainHeading.style.backgroundColor = 'purple'; 
});

The string animationend


Quiz Question
￼
Given this code:

document.addEventListener('keypress', function () {
    document.body.remove();
});
What will happen if the mouse is used to click the page?
￼
nothing


Now it's your turn to write an event listener!

* go to one of your favorite sites
* open the Console pane in DevTools
* use .addEventListener() to register a listener on the document object
* listen for a click event
* when a click happens, log a message to the console

Add Event Listener to the Project

Running code in a browser's developer tools is fantastic for testing. But that event listener will only last until the page is refreshed. As with all real JavaScript code that we want to send to our users, our event listener code needs to be in a JavaScript file.

Let's try adding an Event Listener to our project's files!

Reflect
Think about these interfaces:

EventTarget
Node
Element
Is there a difference between these two:

document.addEventListener()
myHeading.addEventListener() (assume the myHeading variable is an element)

yes, document.addEventListner applied to the whole document but myHeading only applied to that particular html tag.

So far, we've only looked at the "click" event and a couple of other ones. When we used the monitorEvents() function in the previous section, we saw a number of different event types (e.g. dblclick, scroll, resize).

How do you know what events are even out there to listen for? The answer is easy - documentation! To see a full list of all of the possible events you can listen for, check out the Events documentation: list of events

Recap

In this section, you learned all about events, the EventTarget Interface, and how to add event listeners. We used the .addEventListener() method to attach listeners to:

* the document
* a Node
* an Element

...basically anything that inherits from the EventTarget Interface. We also saw that there are three main parts to an event listener:

1. an event target - the target
* the type of event to listen for - the type
* a function to run when the event occurs - the listener

￼
3.4.3 Remove an Event Listener
---------------------------------------
Removing An Event Listener
We say that we can use an event target's .addEventListener() method to start listening for specific events and respond to them. Let's say you only want to listen for just the first click event, respond to it, and ignore all other click events. The .addEventListener() event will listen for and respond to all click events.

(The newest version of the .addEventListener() specification does allow for an object to be passed as a third parameter. This object can be used to configure how the .addEventListener() method behaves. Of note, there is an option to listen for only a single event. However, this configuration object is not widely supported just yet).

To remove an event listener, we use the .removeEventListener() method. It sounds straightforward enough, right? However, before we look at .removeEventListener(), we need to take a brief review of object equality. It seems like an odd jump, but it'll make sense in just a moment.

Are Objects Equal in JavaScript

Equality is a common task in most programming languages, but in JavaScript, it can be a little bit tricky because JavaScript does this thing called type coercion where it will try to convert the items being compared into the same type. (e.g. string, number,). JavaScript has the double equality (==) operator that will allow type coercion. It also has the triple equality (===) symbol that will prevent type coercion when comparing.

Hopefully, this is all review. But let's talk about just object equality, which includes objects, arrays, and functions. Try giving this quiz a shot:

Quiz Question
￼
Will the following equality test result in true or false?

{ name: 'Richard' } === { name: 'Richard' }

false

Quiz Question
￼
Given this code:

var a = {
    myFunction: function quiz() { console.log('hi'); }
};
var b = {
    myFunction: function quiz() { console.log('hi'); }
};
Does the following code evaluate to true or false?

a.myFunction === b.myFunction
￼
false

Quiz Question
￼
Given this code:

function quiz() { ... }

var a = {
    myFunction: quiz
};
var b = {
    myFunction: quiz
}
Does the following code evaluate to true or false?

a.myFunction === b.myFunction
￼
true

Ok, so why do we care about any of this object/function equality? The reason is that the .removeEventListener() method requires you to pass the same exact listener function to it as the one you passed to .addEventListener().

Let's see some pseudo-code for the .removeEventListener():

<event-target>.removeEventListener(<event-to-listen-for>, <function-to-remove>);
So an event listener needs three things:

1. an event target - this is called the target
* the type of event to listen for - this is called the type
* the function to remove - this is called the listener

Remember, the listener function must be the exact same function as the one used in the .addEventListener() call...not just an identical looking function. Let's look at a couple of examples.

This code will successfully add and then remove an event listener:

function myEventListeningFunction() {
    console.log('howdy');
}

// adds a listener for clicks, to run the `myEventListeningFunction` function
document.addEventListener('click', myEventListeningFunction);

// immediately removes the click listener that should run the `myEventListeningFunction` function
document.removeEventListener('click', myEventListeningFunction);

Now, why does this work? It works because both .addEventListener() and .removeEventListener:

* have the same target
* have the same type
* and pass the exact same listener

Now let's look at an example that would not work (it does not remove the event listener):

// adds a listener for clicks, to run the `myEventListeningFunction` function
document.addEventListener('click', function myEventListeningFunction() {
    console.log('howdy');
});

// immediately removes the click listener that should run the `myEventListeningFunction` function
document.removeEventListener('click', function myEventListeningFunction() {
    console.log('howdy');
});

This code does not successfully remove the event listener. Again, why does this not work?

* both .addEventListener() and .removeEventListener have the same target
* both .addEventListener() and .removeEventListener have the same type
* .addEventListener() and .removeEventListener have their own distinct listener functions...they do not refer to the exact same function (this is the reason the event listener removal fails!)

When we wrote

function myEventListeningFunction() {
    console.log('howdy');
}
a second time, we actually created a completely new function that was stored in a completely new location in memory! They may look the same and do the same thing, but that doesn't make them the same. Imagine a scenario where you see two houses that look exactly the same. While the houses might look the same, their addresses are different! That's exactly what just happened in our previous example.

Why don't you try your hand at this!

Quiz Question
￼
Assuming that myForm is a <form> element, will the <form> element have a submit event listener after running the following code, or not?

myForm.addEventListener('submit', function respondToSubmit(){...});
myForm.removeEventListener('submit', function respondToSubmit(){...});

the element will still have an event listener

What's Next?
Now that we've learned about adding and removing event listeners, it's time to learn about the phases of an event!

Recap
In this section, you learned about how to remove event listeners. You took a dive into object equality and how that plays a huge part in removing an event. Lastly, we also looked at how you can find out what event listener a DOM element has by using the DevTools.

3.4.4 Phases of an Event
---------------------------------------
Phases of an Event

Reflect

Thinking about nodes and how the DOM is structured, after running the code below, which event listener will fire first when the page is clicked? Write out your answer and your explanation of why it will be in that order:

because the body receive the event first before bubble up to the document.

Event Phases
There are three different phases during the lifecycle of an event. They are:

* the capturing phase
* the at target phase
* and the bubbling phase

And they actually follow the order above; first, it's capturing, then at target, and then the bubbling phase.

Most event handlers run during the at target phase, such as when you attach a click event handler to the button. The event arrives at the button (its target), and there's only a handler for it right there, so the event handler gets run.

But sometimes you have a collection of items -- such as a list -- and want to have one handler cover every item (and still have the option of individual handlers for some items.) By default, if you click on a child item and a handler doesn't intercept the click, the event will "bubble" upward to the parent, and keep bubbling until something handles it or it hits the document.

Capturing, on the other hand, lets the parent intercept an event before it reaches a child.

Let's dig into these phases to see how they affect when events fire and the order they fire in!

So of the three phases in an event, which one does the .addEventListener() method actually use? And, how can we change it?

Up until this point, we've only seen the .addEventListener() method called with two arguments, the:

* event type
* and the listener

document.addEventListener('click', function () {
   console.log('The document was clicked');
});

There's actually a third argument to the .addEventListener() method; the useCapture argument. From it's name, you'd think that if this argument were left out, .addEventListener() would default to using the capturing phase. This is an incorrect assumption! By default, when .addEventListener() is called with only two arguments, the method defaults to using the bubbling phase.

The code below uses .addEventListener() with only two arguments, so it will invoke the listener during the bubbling phase:

document.addEventListener('click', function () {
   console.log('The document was clicked');
});

However, in this code, .addEventListener() is called with three arguments with the third argument being true (meaning it should invoke the listener earlier, during the capturing phase!).

document.addEventListener('click', function () {
   console.log('The document was clicked');
}, true);

Quiz Question
￼
Which of the phases is the following code set up for?

const items = document.querySelectorAll('.quizzing-quizzes');
const el = items[1];

el.addEventListener('click', function () {
    console.log('You clicked on the 2nd quizzing-quizzes item!');
}, false);

the at bubble phase

Now that you have a little more knowledge about the "capturing", "at target", and "bubbling" phases, we're going to go back to the question at the beginning of this section.

Quiz Question
After running the code below and clicking on the page, two console.log messages will display in the console. Put the messages in the correct order.

document.addEventListener('click', function () {
   console.log('The document was clicked');
});

document.body.addEventListener('click', function () {
    console.log('The body element was clicked');
});￼

These are the correct matches.

Order of Messages  console.log Message
First Message      The body element was clicked.
Second Message     The document was clicked.

The Event Object
Now that you know that event listeners fire in a specific order and how to interpret and control that order, it's time to shift focus to the details of the event itself.

When an event occurs, the browser includes an event object. This is just a regular JavaScript object that includes a ton of information about the event itself. According to MDN, the .addEventListener()'s listener function receives:

a notification (an object that implements the Event interface) when an event of the specified type occurs

Up until this point, I've been writing all of the listener functions without any parameter to store this event object. Let's add a parameter so we can store this important information:

document.addEventListener('click', function (event) {  // ← the `event` parameter is new!
   console.log('The document was clicked');
});
Notice the new event parameter that's been added to the listener function. Now when the listener function is called, it is able to store the event data that's passed to it!

💡 An "event" is an "evt" is an "e" 💡

Remember that a function's parameter is just like a regular variable. In the following example, I'm using a parameter with the name event.

const items = document.querySelectorAll('.quizzing-quizzes');
const el = items[1];

el.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
    console.log('You clicked on the 2nd quizzing-quizzes item!');
});

Instead of event, the parameter's name could just as easily be:

* evt
* e
* theEvent
* horse

The name event or evt does not provide any inherent meaning or special capabilities; there is nothing special to the name... it's just the name of the parameter. Feel free to give it any name that's informative/descriptive!

The Default Action
As we just looked at, the event object stores a lot of information, and we can use this data to do all sorts of things. However, one incredibly common reason that professionals use the event object for, is to prevent the default action from happening. That sounds like an odd thing to do, but let's explore this.

Think about an anchor link on a webpage. There are probably a couple dozen links on this page! What if you wanted to run some code and display some output when you click on one of these links. If you click on the link, it will automatically navigate you to the location listed in its href attribute: that's what it does by default.

What about a form element? When you submit a form, by default, it will send the data to the location in its action attribute. What if we wanted to validate the data before sending it, though?

Without the event object, we're stuck with the default actions. However, the event object has a .preventDefault() method on it that a handler can call to prevent the default action from occurring!

const links = document.querySelectorAll('a');
const thirdLink = links[2];

thirdLink.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Look, ma! We didn't navigate to a new page!");
});

Recap
We covered a number of important aspects of events and event listeners in this section! We looked at:

* the phases of an event:
 * the capturing phase
 * the at target phase
 * the bubbling phase
* the event object
* prevent the default action with .preventDefault()

3.4.5 Avoid Too Many Events
---------------------------------------
Avoid Too Many Events
How many event listeners are created with this code?

const myCustomDiv = document.createElement('div');

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    newElement.addEventListener('click', function respondToTheClick(evt) {
        console.log('A paragraph was clicked.');
    });

    myCustomDiv.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(myCustomDiv);

Enter the number of event listeners below. (enter numbers, only)

200

Refactoring The Number of Event Listeners
Let's look at the code another time:

const myCustomDiv = document.createElement('div');

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    newElement.addEventListener('click', function respondToTheClick() {
        console.log('A paragraph was clicked.');
    });

    myCustomDiv.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(myCustomDiv);

We're creating a <div> element, attaching two hundred paragraph elements and attaching an event listener with a respondToTheClick function to each paragraph as we create it. There are a number of ways we could refactor this code. For example, as of right now, we're creating two hundred different respondToTheClick functions (that all actually do the exact same thing!). We could extract this function and just reference the function instead of creating two hundred different functions:

const myCustomDiv = document.createElement('div');

function respondToTheClick() {
    console.log('A paragraph was clicked.');
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    newElement.addEventListener('click', respondToTheClick);

    myCustomDiv.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(myCustomDiv);

This is a great step in the right direction!

However, we still have two hundred event listeners. They're all pointing to the same listener function, but there are still two hundred different event listeners.

What if we moved all of the listeners to the <div> instead?

The code for this would look like:

const myCustomDiv = document.createElement('div');

function respondToTheClick() {
    console.log('A paragraph was clicked.');
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    myCustomDiv.appendChild(newElement);
}

myCustomDiv.addEventListener('click', respondToTheClick);

document.body.appendChild(myCustomDiv);

Now there is only:

* a single event listener
* a single listener function

Now the browser doesn't have to store in memory two hundred different event listeners and two hundred different listener functions. That's great for performance`!

However, if you test the code above, you'll notice that we've lost access to the individual paragraphs. There's no way for us to target a specific paragraph element. So how do we combine this efficient code with the access to the individual paragraph items that we did before?

We use a process called event delegation.

Event Delegation

Remember the event object that we looked at in the previous section? That's our ticket to getting back the original functionality!

The event object has a .target property. This property references the target of the event. Remember the capturing, at target, and bubbling phases?...these are coming back into play here, too!

Let's say that you click on a paragraph element. Here's roughly the process that happens:

1. a paragraph element is clicked
* the event goes through the capturing phase
* it reaches the target
* it switches to the bubbling phase and starts going up the DOM tree
* when it hits the <div> element, it runs the listener function
* inside the listener function, event.target is the element that was clicked

So event.target gives us direct access to the paragraph element that was clicked. Because we have access to the element directly, we can access its .textContent, modify its styles, update the classes it has - we can do anything we want to it!

const myCustomDiv = document.createElement('div');

function respondToTheClick(evt) {
    console.log('A paragraph was clicked: ' + evt.target.textContent);
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    myCustomDiv.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(myCustomDiv);

myCustomDiv.addEventListener('click', respondToTheClick);

Checking the Node Type in Event Delegation
In the code snippet we used above, we added the event listener directly to the <div> element. The listener function logs a message saying that a paragraph element was clicked (and then the text of the target element). This works perfectly! However, there is nothing to ensure that it was actually a <p> tag that was clicked before running that message. In this snippet, the <p> tags were direct children of the <div> element, but what happens if we had the following HTML:

<article id="content">
  <p>Brownie lollipop <span>carrot cake</span> gummies lemon drops sweet roll dessert tiramisu. Pudding muffin <span>cotton candy</span> croissant fruitcake tootsie roll. Jelly jujubes brownie. Marshmallow jujubes topping sugar plum jelly jujubes chocolate.</p>

  <p>Tart bonbon soufflé gummi bears. Donut marshmallow <span>gingerbread cupcake</span> macaroon jujubes muffin. Soufflé candy caramels tootsie roll powder sweet roll brownie <span>apple pie</span> gummies. Fruitcake danish chocolate tootsie roll macaroon.</p>
</article>

In this filler text, notice that there are some <span> tags. If we want to listen to the <article> for a click on a <span>, you might think that this would work:

document.querySelector('#content').addEventListener('click', function (evt) {
    console.log('A span was clicked with text ' + evt.target.textContent);
});

This will work, but there's a major flaw. The listener function will still fire when either one of the paragraph elements is clicked, too! In other words, this listener function is not verifying that the target of the event is actually a <span> element. Let's add in this check:

document.querySelector('#content').addEventListener('click', function (evt) {
    if (evt.target.nodeName === 'SPAN') {  // ← verifies target is desired element
        console.log('A span was clicked with text ' + evt.target.textContent);
    }
});

Remember that every element inherits properties from the Node Interface. One of the properties of the Node Interface that is inherited is .nodeName. We can use this property to verify that the target element is actually the element we're looking for. When a <span> element is clicked, it will have a .nodeName property of "SPAN", so the check will pass and the message will be logged. However, if a <p> element is clicked, it will have a .nodeName property of "P", so the check will fail and the message will not be logged.

⚠️ The nodeName's Capitalization ⚠️
The .nodeName property will return an uppercase string, not a lowercase one. So when you perform your check make sure to either:

* check for capital letters
* convert the .nodeName to lowercase

// check using capital letters
if (evt.target.nodeName === 'SPAN') {
    console.log('A span was clicked with text ' + evt.target.textContent);
}

> // convert nodeName to lowercase
if (evt.target.nodeName.toLowerCase() === 'span') {
    console.log('A span was clicked with text ' + evt.target.textContent);
}

Recap
In this section, we looked at Event Delegation. Event Delegation is the process of delegating to a parent element the ability to manage events for child elements. We were able to do this by making use of:

* the event object and its .target property
* the different phases of an event

￼
3.4.6 Know When The DOM Is Ready
---------------------------------------
The DOM Is Built Incrementally
Do you remember the video we watched of Illya from Google explaining how the DOM is parsed? A key thing to point out is that when the HTML is received and converted into tokens and built into the document object model, is that this is a sequential process. When the parser gets to a <script> tag, it must wait to download the script file and execute that JavaScript code. This is the important part and the key to why the placement of the JavaScript file matters!

Let's look at some code to show (more or less) what's happening. Take a look at this initial part of an HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
  <script>
    document.querySelector('footer').style.backgroundColor = 'purple';
  </script>

This isn't the full HTML file...BUT, it's all that's been parsed so far. Notice at the bottom of the code that we have so far is a <script> file. This is using inline JavaScript rather than pointing to an external file. The inline file will execute faster because the browser doesn't have to make another network request to fetch the JavaScript file. But the outcome will be exactly the same for both this inline version and if the HTML had linked to an external JavaScript file.

Do you see the JavaScript/DOM code in the <script> tags? Take a second and read it again:

document.querySelector('footer').style.backgroundColor = 'purple';
Does anything jump out at you about this code? Anything at all? This code is completely error-free...unfortunately, when it runs, it will still cause an error. Any ideas why?

The problem is with the .querySelector() method. When it runs...there's no <footer> element to select from the constructed document object model yet! So instead of returning a DOM element, it will return null. This causes an error because it would be like running the following code:

null.style.backgroundColor = 'purple';
null doesn't have a .style property, so thus our error is born.

Now, we've already used one solution to this issue. Remember that we moved the JavaScript file down to the bottom of the page. Think about why this would make things work. Well, if the DOM is built sequentially, if the JavaScript code is moved to the very bottom of the page, then by the time the JavaScript code is run, all DOM elements will already exist!

However, an alternative solution would be to use browser events! 🙌🏼

The Content Is Loaded Event
When the document object model has been fully loaded, the browser will fire an event. This event is called the DOMContentLoaded event, and we can listen for it the same way we listen to any other events:

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    console.log('the DOM is ready to be interacted with!');
});

Quiz Question
￼
On what event target should we listen for the DOMContentLoaded event?

￼
the document object

Using the DOMContentLoaded Event
Because we now know about the DOMContentLoaded event, we can use it to keep our JS code in the <head>.

Let's update the previous HTML code to include this event:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
    <script>
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
          document.querySelector('footer').style.backgroundColor = 'purple';
      });
    </script>

Pretty cool, right?!? We have the JavaScript code in the <head> element, but it is now wrapped in an event listener for the DOMContentLoaded event. This will prevent the DOM-styling code from running when the browser gets to it. Then, when the DOM has been constructed, the event will fire and this code will run.

If you're looking at somebody else's code, you may see that their code listens for the load event being used instead (e.g. document.onload(...)). load fires later than DOMContentLoaded -- load waits until all of the images, stylesheets, etc. have been loaded (everything referenced by the HTML.) Many older developers use load in place of DOMContentLoaded as the latter wasn't supported by the very earliest browsers. But if you need to detect when your code can run, DOMContentLoaded is generally the better choice.

However, just because you can use the DOMContentLoaded event to write JavaScript code in the <head> that doesn't mean you should do this. Doing it this way, we have to write more code (all of the event listening stuff) and more code is usually not always the best way to do something. Instead, it would be better to move the code to the bottom of the HTML file just before the closing </body> tag.

So when would you want to use this technique? Well, JavaScript code in the <head> will run before JavaScript code in the <body>, so if you do have JavaScript code that needs to run as soon as possible, then you could put that code in the <head> and wrap it in a DOMContentLoaded event listener. This way it will run as early as possible, but not too early that the DOM isn't ready for it.

Recap
In this section, we learned about the helpful DOMContentLoaded event.

Along the way, we reviewed how the HTML code is parsed incrementally and how this affects JavaScript/DOM code. We also looked at why writing DOM-manipulation code in the <head> can cause errors.
