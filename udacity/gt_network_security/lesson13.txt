13.7 Encryption Quiz
---------------------------------------
property preserving
encrypted data is in the same order as the plaintext.

searchable
encrypted data that can be searched using encrypted keywords

secure computation
several parties can compute a function using inputs that are kept private.

homomorphic
computations performed on encrypted data matches that result of the computation on the plaintext.

functional
a secret key that allows someone to learn the function that is being encrypted.
