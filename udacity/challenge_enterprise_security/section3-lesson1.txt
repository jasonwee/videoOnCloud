3.1.1 Meet your instructor
---------------------------------------
Hello everyone, welcome to Udacity!
My name is Milind Adari and I'll be your instructor for this course on Enterprise Perimeter and Network Security.
A little bit about me:

* I work as an Information Security Engineer at The Associated Press
* I teach a cybersecurity bootcamp at Columbia University
* I have a Masters Degree in Management & Information Systems from NYU and a Bachelors in Computer Science & Psychology from Rutgers University



3.1.2 Lesson Overview
---------------------------------------
Thanks for being a student in this course!

In this introductory lesson, we'll give you a helpful overview of the course that will set you up for success:

* Course prerequisites
* Overview of the course topics
* Why enterprise perimeter and network security is important
* Stakeholders in your business with whom you'll interact around network security
* Historical development of enterprise network security
* Preview of the end-of-course project
* Overview of the tools and environment you'll use for your project and exercises throughout the course



3.1.3 Prerequisites
---------------------------------------
Course Prerequisites
* Experience setting up and configuring a Linux server
* Experience setting up an Azure cloud environment
* Exposure to networking and security devices
 * Able to explain the relationship between client and server within a web architecture
 * Able to identify common networking protocols (HTTP, SSH, DNS, etc.)
 * Able to distinguish between different hardware components in a network (firewall, load balancer, IDS/IPS)
* Patience!



3.1.4 Course Overview
---------------------------------------
Course Learning Objectives
We first start by looking at an enterprise's perspective in designing network security architecture. In this first lesson you will learn to:

* Identify weaknesses in network topologies
* Design the placement of security devices in an enterprise network
* Use the SABSA framework to align enterprise business and security needs

Then we move on to the next lesson on building an enterprise network, where you will learn to:

* Connect from public to private networks over a NAT gateway
* Segment a virtual network into multiple subnets
* Build a VPN solution to connect to an enterprise network

Then we dive into continuous monitoring with a SIEM. By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* Deploy a SIEM
* Setup alerts and monitor traffic
* Build an Incident Response Playbook

Lastly in our final lesson, we'll give you an introduction to Zero Trust. You will learn to:

* Define the principles of Zero Trust
* Identify key components in Zero Trust architecture
* Design a Zero Trust mod



3.1.5 Network Security is essential for enterprises
---------------------------------------
Enterprise perimeter and network security is incredibly important!
* In just the past year enterprises had 36 billion records exposed due to data breaches
* $3.86 million is the average cost of a data breach
* 30% of data breaches involved insider threats
* Cybercrime costs are expected to rise and hit a total of $6 trillion in 2021



3.1.6 evolution of perimeter and network security
---------------------------------------
Milestones in the Historical Development of Enterprise Network Security
* 1969 - Dr. Howard Frank designs the ARPAnet and some of the first network topologies
* 1992 - DEC SEAL is the first commercial firewall
* 1996 - Microsoft develops the first Virtual Private Network (VPN), a peer to peer tunnel
* 2006 - Amazon unveils Amazon Web Services (AWS), providing commercial cloud resources
* 2010 - John Kindervag creates Zero Trust
* 2014 - The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publishes the first cybersecurity framework



3.1.7 business stackholders
---------------------------------------
Roles in an Enterprise Involved with Perimeter and Network Security
* Security staff
* Information Technology staff
* C-Suite (executives)



3.1.8 project and tools overview 
---------------------------------------
Your final project, Securing the Perimeter, will be a culmination of all the skills you learn throughout the course.
* Part 1: Designing a Secure Network Architecture
* Part 2: Building a Secure Network Architecture in Azure
* Part 3: Monitoring with a SIEM
* Part 4: Zero Trust Model

Tools and Environment
In this course we'll use the following tools:

* Microsoft Azure
* ELK stack
 * Elasticsearch
 * Logstash
 * Kibana
* Linux Ubuntu
Access to all of these tools will be provided to you in the project and in exercises in a Virtual Machine (VM), in a workspace inside your classroom.



3.1.9 good luck!
