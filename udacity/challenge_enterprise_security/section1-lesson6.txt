1.6.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
Summary
Welcome to the sixth lesson in this course where you learn to apply what you’ve learned throughout the course. Learning theory is important to understanding the underlying reasons why we do what we do. However, you need to be able to apply it to your home and work environments. This lesson and your subsequent project gives you hands-on experience in assessing a sample Windows 10 operating system like you’d find in many businesses. You have the opportunity to put your hacker hat on and apply security defenses.



1.6.2 Appolying Cybersecurity
---------------------------------------
Summary
The application of cybersecurity principles follows a few steps.

1. Identifying assets. Identify which users, machines, software, and networks belong to your organization.
2. Analyze vulnerabilities and threats. You need to identify where an attack might arise, and how.
3. Recommend how to secure and protect your organization’s assets based on your analysis.
4. Communicate with others and convince them to adopt your recommendations to keep the organization safe.



1.6.3 Lesson Outline
---------------------------------------
Lesson Outline
Throughout this lesson, you will understand methods for establishing and maintaining the security of a network, computing environment, and application. There are three sections:

* Identify existing assets and security controls
* Analyze vulnerabilities and threats, and
* Recommend and apply basic security controls.

Lesson Learning Objectives:
* Categorize assets, risks, threats, vulnerabilities, exploits
* Identify the organizational asset(s)
* Analyze vulnerabilities and risks to those organizational assets
* Recommend and apply basic security controls



1.6.4 Identify Existing Assets and Security Controls
---------------------------------------
Identifying Hardware and Software Assets and Security Controls summary
According to the CIS Controls, there are multiple options for you to identify assets and devices on your network

* You can use active or passive discovery tools to identify devices on the organization’s network.
 * Active tools like the NMAP application can query a network range for all IP addresses.
 * Passive tools like Windows DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) automatically distributes IP addresses when a device attaches to a network.

* Many organizations also have a manual list of organizational assets in a database or spreadsheet.
* An option on a network is port-level access control that controls which devices can authenticate to the network.

The CIS Controls has direction for identifying and controlling software programs as well.

* Many organizations maintain a list of organizational assets in a database, a commercial software inventory tool, or Windows Server Update Services.
* Restrict who has administrative authority.
* Application whitelisting is a list of what’s allowed on your systems. Anything that’s not on the list is automatically denied from being installed or used.

Once you have an inventory, all organizations should address any unauthorized hardware or software assets on the network.

NMAP walkthrough

Nmap
Nmap, short for network mapper, is a commonly used tool to query network devices. It’s been around for over 20 years and has both a command line and GUI interface.

Further research
* More information on this topic is available from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls framework.
* Nmap is a common application used to map networks. It is free and an open-source for network discovery and security auditing. https://nmap.org/

1.6.9 Analyze Vulnerabiliteis and Threats
---------------------------------------
Analyze Vulnerabilities and Threats
In this lesson, we’ll look at three primary areas within a Windows Operating System that may contain vulnerabilities:

* Shared folders and files - Folders and files are often shared by users to make it easier for others to view or modify them.

  The threat is that you don’t always know who may be able to see or change their content. Ransomware is another threat that will often try to lock file shares on a network until the ransom is paid. It’s good to know what files and folders are shared on both a PC and across a network

* Windows Services - These are executable applications that often run continuously in the background. They can be automatically started when a computer starts. Trigger events can also start services, like when you run a particular application. Services running that aren’t needed can bog down a computer.

A potential security threat is that running services can allow unauthorized access to the computer or its contents.

* Windows and Application Updates

Malicious software is a continual threat to unpatched systems and applications. Other threats include unauthorized access to the system or data or the disclosure of sensitive data.

1.6.12 Analyze Vulnerabilities and Threats Solution
---------------------------------------
Windows and Application Updates Summary
As a part of a security assessment, you should ensure all systems and applications are updated based on the vendor's standards. Microsoft makes this easy between their websites and the ability to automatically update Windows. Having all systems stay up-to-date on patches is one of the best ways to reduce the likelihood of software vulnerabilities from impacting your work.




1.6.13 Recommend and Apply Basic Security Controls
---------------------------------------
Recommend and Apply Basic Security Controls
Once you identify potential security issues like vulnerabilities and threats, you need to recommend how to minimize the risks. These are putting protective or detective measures in place to meet security requirements and keep others from breaking it either on purpose or by accident. This can be done with technical settings, corporate policies, user training, or all three. You can use the CIS Controls™ for guidance on how you should secure computer systems.

Secure the Configuration of Software, Operating Systems & Networks includes the following steps:
* Application Security - Remove unneeded applications and make sure the rest are up-to-date on patches.
* End-Point Protection - Make sure antivirus and firewall applications are on and they stay up to date. For Windows 10, this is known as Windows Defender.
* Security Policy settings - Configure the operating system to log events

Access Control includes:
* Account ownership
* Administrative Privileges
* Limit accounts in the Administrator group
* User Account Control (UAC) on Windows

---------------------------------------
Jill & Roy's Accounting - Case Study
You should be familiar with this case study from an earlier lesson. But notice that more information has been added.

Jill and Roy provide accounting services throughout their area. They employ 7 full-time workers: 4 accountants, 1 office administrator, and themselves. They also have about a dozen seasonal workers during tax season.

They use Microsoft 365 (aka Office 365) for all of their office applications (email, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). For their accounting, they use Intuit's Quickbooks and ProConnect online versions. They have a single office with a network router to their ISP, a Linksys LGS116P Ethernet Switch and a Linksys AC1900 WiFi Router.

The full-time accountants each have a Lenovo ThinkPad T490 and the office administrator has a Lenovo desktop. All company workstation computers use Windows 10 and Google Chrome for their standard web browser. All users have administrator rights on their PC and many have installed their own software, which includes games and media streaming applications.

They also have one internal Windows 10 Lenovo desktop that they use as a centralized print and file server that sits in the main office area. Only Roy, Jill, and the office admin have an account on it. They recently allowed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) into it to allow employees to access files from home. The temporary workers use their own laptops, which are a mixture of Windows and Macs. It's known that some of the temporary accountant workers will download client files onto their personal computers to work offline.

The office has a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy for all cell phones (a mix of Apple iPhones and Android). Cell phones are used for business email and to speak with office workers and clients.

Jill & Roys has a contract with a local IT company to provide services, which includes a weekly backup of the file/print server, monthly updating of Microsoft products on office computers, and maintenance of the network equipment.

Answer the questions below based on this case study.

Part 1: Recommendations

Recommendations
Based on the case study described above, provide three recommendations to improve security for Jill & Roy's Accounting. Consider the following areas: access and authority, passwords, updating, network access, and use of personnel devices for work.

Your reflection
only allow access and authority to certain staffs based on their workscope password updating with maximum age and password strength is require only allow network access until the workscope require personnel devices for work is kept at minimal.

Things to think about
Jill & Roy's have many areas to improve their cybersecurity posture. Below are sample answers:

* All users should have local or standard user privileges and not be an administrator. The risk is that unauthorized software could be installed. You should remove administrator rights for all users and there should be a separate administrator account for installing new programs on PCs.
* You should set a password policy using the Local Security Policy as explained in an earlier lesson. All users should have a password that is at least 8 characters, changed at least every 90 days, and meets the complexity requirements. You can also set the account lockout policies.
* Remove any applications that aren't needed for the business.
* Ensure the Windows operating system and all applications are set to auto-update.
* Review running services including the use of Remote Desktop (RDP). That service should be disabled for the business's file/print server. Jill & Roy's should use a secured cloud service for sharing sensitive files.
* Review the firewall rules that allow access into the internal network.
* Create and deliver user security awareness training for all employees. This should include the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and on the use of personal devices and their safe use for businesses.
* Create an announcement upon log-in to remind all employees that these computers are to be for Jill & Roy's business-use only.
