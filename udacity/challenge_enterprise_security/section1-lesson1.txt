Summary
In today’s online world, security is a major concern of virtually everyone on the Internet. Consider the reasons why: attacks directed at point-of-sale computer systems resulted in over one billion credit cards being stolen in a single year.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has a top priority to “Protect the United States against cyber-based attacks and high-technology crimes”

What is Cybersecurity? According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (aka NIST), it’s the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Source: NIST CSRC Glossary https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cybersecurity

Throughout this course, you’ll gain an understanding of ways to make your data, your computers, and devices like laptops, tablets, smartphones, and networks secure. This course presents a basic introduction to practical computer security for all types of users to reduce cyber risks to you, your organization, and the community.

Course Prerequisites
A well-prepared learner is already able to:

* Understand the basic principles of network connectivity.
* Understand basic operating system fundamentals including Windows or Linux.

Quiz Question
Which of the following is not a goal of cybersecurity according to NIST?
Usability



1.1.6 Cybersecurity and You
---------------------------------------
Cybersecurity and You
In today’s world, everyone is online. Computers are all around us; on our wrists, in our pockets, in our cars and homes and of course businesses. With all this technology, comes risks and dangers.

* What if someone was able to gain access to your computers, accounts, and sensitive data?
* How much damage could they do?
* What do we need to do to secure our technologies?

It’s up to each of us to do our part in securing our cyber world. Failure to do so not only affects you but the world, businesses, and people around you. A single moment where you unconsciously click a link could take down your organization.
Learning how to protect yourself better online may be one reason you’re in this course.

Another reason may be to get employed in a cybersecurity career. According to the Security Magazine, 76% of security leaders believe there is a shortage of cybersecurity skills. That means there are many opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.



1.1.7 Business stackholders
---------------------------------------
Security in Business
According to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), "The Internet allows businesses of all sizes, types, industries, and from any location to reach new and larger markets and provides opportunities to work more efficiently by using computer-based tools. Whether an organization is thinking of adopting cloud computing or just using email and maintaining a website, cybersecurity should be a part of the plan. Theft of digital information has become the most commonly reported fraud, surpassing physical theft. Every business that uses the Internet is responsible for creating a culture of security that will enhance business and consumer confidence."

Here are some of the topics related to business protection that we’ll cover in this class:

* Cybersecurity basics,
* Understanding the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,
* Physical Security,
* Attacks such as ransomware and phishing,
* Email security, and
* Securing remote access.

The US Federal Trade Commission website on cybersecurity for small business provides information all businesses need to know to protect their technologies, data, and people from cyber attacks. This is more evidence of the importance of cybersecurity for business. Consider this website as a resource not only in this course but throughout your professional career.

Quiz Question
Go to the FTC Cybersecurity for Small Business website and review the topic areas under Protect Your Small Business. (Note that these apply to businesses of all types and sizes.)

1.1.8 History of Cybersecurity
---------------------------------------
History of Computer Viruses and Worms
With the start of the Internet in the late 1960s, known then as the ARPANET came a need to secure the data, connections, and computer systems for those using it; mostly research institutions, universities, and governments. Computers in the early days of the Internet often didn’t have basic protection and used telephone modems to dial-into the network. Highlights of memorable computer viruses and worms include:

* 1968 - Development of the ARPANET (early Internet)
* 1971 - First reported computer worm - Creeper
* 1986 - Brain MS-DOS virus
* 1989 - Morris Worm - Internet Denial of Service
* 2000 - ILOVEYOU Worm
* 2010 - Stuxnet

1.1.9 Tools & Environment
---------------------------------------
Cybersecurity Environments, Tools, and Websites
To work in cybersecurity, you need to be familiar with typical environments, operating systems and tools. In this course, we’ll mainly focus on the Windows 10 operating system, since it’s the predominant platform for most end-users in business. It’s okay if you don’t have one to use as we’ll give you access to one. Most Windows operating systems come with built-in security tools. Some of the Windows components you’ll use are:

* The Control Panel
* Computer Management
* Local Security Policies

There are also other tools that help you as a cybersecurity professional. These include:

* Sysinternals Suite
* Windows God Mode
* NMap - network mapper
* 7-Zip

The number 1 tool you’ll use is a search engine like Bing or Google. We use it to help find information on any topic.

Lastly, you’ll be exploring numerous websites that provide specific information about security topics such as the largest cyber breaches, software vulnerabilities, and security standards.

Don't be overwhelmed by so many tools. We will walk you through in subsequent lessons when you need to use them.

1.1.10 Introducting Cloud Labs
---------------------------------------
Introducing Cloud Labs
For the current course, you will practice on the following virtual machines (VMs):

VM Name         OS              Purpose
CYBERND01PRJ01	Windows 10 Pro	Course exercises
JoesGaragePC	Windows 10 Pro	Course project

The instructor has explicitly created the VMs above for you to practice your skills. Students can work inside VMs using either of the options below:
* Option 1 - Work in the Udacity Cloud Labs or
* Option 2 (only for Windows 10 users) - Set these VMs up in your personal Azure account.

Option 1 - Udacity Cloud Labs
Udacity Cloud Labs are the Virtual machines made available to you on the pages labeled "Cloud Lab - <VM_Name>". The VMs in the Cloud Labs are actually running on the Azure cloud.

Start the Cloud Lab VM
* Click on the ACCESS LAB button. Wait until the Cloud Lab loads (this could take up to 10 minutes)
* You can use the Cloud Lab VM in the classroom. For Linux VM's, go to the Lab Environment tab to get the SSH credentials for connecting from your local machine.

Tip: Access the Cloud Labs from an incognito browser to have a seamless experience.

Known Issue in the Cloud Lab
While accessing the cloud lab VM in the browser, a problem with the keyboard input may occur, where the VM will not recognize the keystrokes from your local machine. As a result, you will not be able to type (write) any characters in the cloud lab VM.

As a workaround to resolve this issue, you can click somewhere on the Resource tab on the right collapsible pane and click back in the VM desktop, as shown in the snapshot below.

Restrictions
* Cloud Labs' session time is limited. Your session will expire after the validity expires, and you will lose all your resources in the temporary Azure account.
* Later, when you come back or refresh the Cloud lab page, you will get a new VM with a new pair of temporary credentials.
* You will not be able to create additional Resource Groups. There is one resource group already created for you named cloud-demo-XXXXXX. Choose the existing Resource Group when creating resources.
* You will not be able to create Active Directory resources. This is not a requirement for any project/exercise.

If you are not familiar with Azure, you can ignore the restriction points above.

Option 2 - Only for Windows 10 Users
If you have a Windows 10 computer, you can follow the steps below and run the given Azure Powershell script to create a VM in your Azure account.

You will work in the CYBERND01PRJ01 for exercises and JoesGaragePC for the final project.

Prerequisites: You should have an Azure account.

1. Download this Zip file, and unzip it when the download is completed. It has an Azure Powershell script, Initialize-Udacity.CYBERND01.LabVM2.ps1.

2. After downloading the script, follow these steps to run the script file. Running the script successfully will create a VM - CYBERND01PRJ1 in your Azure account. The setup process may take up to 30 min to finish.

3. Once the Azure VM is up and running,

* For Windows machine, use it in the classroom.

* For Linux machine, use SSH to connect remotely from your local or Windows 10 VM.

Use the IP address as "Computer name" and click Connect. Username and password are:

Username: 
Password: 

IMPORTANT: Always shut down all your virtual machines, across all regions, when not in use to avoid charges! The status of all virtual machines should be stopped! You can shut down the VM by clicking the Power button and “shut down” inside the VM or click on the “Stop” button on Azure portal.
