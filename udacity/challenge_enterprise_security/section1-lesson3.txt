1.3.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
Summary
Organizations worldwide are required to maintain a secure technical infrastructure for the reasons stated earlier.
In this lesson, we'll go over some of the leading cybersecurity laws, regulations, standards, and frameworks. These help organizations of all sizes know what to do in securing their infrastructure.



1.3.2 Rules Governing Cybersecurity
---------------------------------------
Summary
It’s important for you to know the rules governing cybersecurity you'll need to make sure you and your organization are following those rules. In this lesson, you'll learn about influential, international organizations that develop and maintain the standards used by companies worldwide to defend data, computers, and networks.

There are organizations responsible for setting the standards in the US and Internationally. There are also ones that focus on specific areas.

* In the United States, that organization is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also known as NIST.
* The International Organization for Standards or ISO works with the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC to set worldwide technology standards.
* There are also governing bodies that set the rules for specific areas. For example, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) has the Data Security Standards that are required for any business accepting or handling credit card data.

Why do we need security standards?

* For safety, to make sure technology doesn’t cause problems for people or other technologies
* Allow technology interconnectivity
* Make sure everyone is playing by the same rules (this is known as compliance)
* For efficiency

1.3.12 NIST Cybersecurity Framework
---------------------------------------
NIST Cybersecurity Framework - Overview

NIST CSF
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps to simplify the process of maturing an organization’s cybersecurity program. By following NIST CSF, businesses experience fewer breaches and compliance issues. NIST CSF consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical infrastructure.

The Framework Tiers describe how mature an organization is when it comes to cybersecurity technology, management, and operational practices. The more mature, the more efficient, effective, and secure. There are four tiers. A company new to NIST would start at Tier 1, while a mature program would be a level 3 or 4.

The CSF Core is a set of cybersecurity activities organized into high-level functions and categories. Using non-technical and straightforward language, it provides a translation layer among multi-disciplinary teams. The Core includes five high-level functions: Identity, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The categories fit within the functions and provide greater direction on implementing the function.

The NIST CSF organizational Profile forms the company’s unique alignment of business objectives, threats, risks, and requirements. By comparing the current profile with a target profile, the company can identify the area to improve the cybersecurity.

The NIST CSF Tiers, Core, and Profile provide direction on implementing a compliant security program that manages its cybersecurity risks to acceptable levels.

NIST CSF Core - Functions
The NIST CSF five Functions or steps are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

1. Identify valuable company assets and data.
2. Protect valuable company assets and data from threats.
3. Detect when a cyber incident occurs.
4. Respond quickly and efficiently to a cyber incident.
5. Recover from an incident and get back to business

NIST CSF Core - Categories
The next layer of the CSF Core is Categories, which are a set of cybersecurity activities and outcomes organized into 23 Categories. Each category has a unique identifier based on the function and category name. It’s what you need to do or prove you do for a cybersecurity program. It uses simplistic and non-technical language to provide easy communication between multi-disciplinary teams.

1.3.15 NIST Cybersecurity Framework Exercise Solution
---------------------------------------
NIST CSF function summary

* The first function, Identify: identify and document your valuable business assets and inventories. This step assists you with recognizing the valuable technology, data, and other resources your company owns.

* The second function, Protect: ways you can secure the items you identified in step one. Ways to establish valid protection come in many forms, including nontechnical human components, such as security awareness. On the other side are technical products or services requiring some level of expertise, such as network security with firewalls and web filters, malware and virus protection, patching and updating, and encryption.

* The third function, Detect: a real or potential incident as quickly as possible. This allows you to quickly and easily respond and recover. Detect is a process of developing and implementing activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event, with a focus on finding of such events.

* The fourth function, Respond: Once you detect a problem, whether it’s a security breach, network outage, or system misconfiguration, you need to respond. This is your plan for handling incidents to ensure minimal organizational impacts.

* The fifth function, Recovery: when an incident is properly responded, you may need to recover your organizational activities. To get your operations quickly back to normal can lessen the financial and human costs of a cybersecurity incident. The more resilient you are, the less your organization is effected.

By using the NIST CSF functions and categories, organizations experience fewer breaches and security compliance issues.



1.3.16 Center for Internet Security
---------------------------------------
Center for Internet Security Best Practices
In the final section of this lesson, we look at the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Cybersecurity Best Practices. The Center for Internet Security is a non-profit organization that leads a global community of IT professionals in developing security standards to safeguard against emerging threats.

Their best practices are made up of two parts:

* The Critical Security Controls, also known as the CIS CSC or CIS Controls™ which are the top 20 activities for organizational security.
* The CIS Benchmarks™ are guidelines to secure or lockdown operating systems, software, applications and networks

They are both developed by a community of cybersecurity professionals from many different areas with the goal of establishing a form of a checklist of activities as organizations mature their cybersecurity programs.

The CIS Controls™ is separated into three functional areas that the CIS calls Implementation Groups:

* Basic Controls
* Foundational Controls
* Organizational Controls
