1.3.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
Summary
Organizations worldwide are required to maintain a secure technical infrastructure for the reasons stated earlier.
In this lesson, we'll go over some of the leading cybersecurity laws, regulations, standards, and frameworks. These help organizations of all sizes know what to do in securing their infrastructure.



1.3.2 Rules Governing Cybersecurity
---------------------------------------
Summary
It’s important for you to know the rules governing cybersecurity you'll need to make sure you and your organization are following those rules. In this lesson, you'll learn about influential, international organizations that develop and maintain the standards used by companies worldwide to defend data, computers, and networks.

There are organizations responsible for setting the standards in the US and Internationally. There are also ones that focus on specific areas.

* In the United States, that organization is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also known as NIST.
* The International Organization for Standards or ISO works with the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC to set worldwide technology standards.
* There are also governing bodies that set the rules for specific areas. For example, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) has the Data Security Standards that are required for any business accepting or handling credit card data.

Why do we need security standards?

* For safety, to make sure technology doesn’t cause problems for people or other technologies
* Allow technology interconnectivity
* Make sure everyone is playing by the same rules (this is known as compliance)
* For efficiency

As you learned during the lesson, Governance establishes authority, management, and decision making related to information systems and data. The different types of policy documents set the rules all need to follow or at least be aware of.
Udacity uses Governance for its users so you know their rules and expectations. These are often required by government regulators to be compliant with data security and privacy laws. In this exercise, we'll explore some of the Udacity policies on their legal website: https://www.udacity.com/legal.
On that website, click on Udacity's Terms of Use, which sets the rules for using Udacity's website and services and answer the quiz questions below.

Security and Privacy Professionals need to be very knowledgeable about the different types of Policies and how they are used. I encourage you to explore Udacity's policies as an example.
