1.2.2 Cybersecurity Overview
---------------------------------------
Note: in the video, it says the cybersecurity market is expected to grow "to $300 billion" by 2024. It should be "to over $300 billion".

Summary
Internet of Things (IoT) refers to anything that is connected to a network, such as computers, our phones, tablets, laptop, and desktop computers as well as those we don’t see in our cars, TVs, speakers, and watches.

We also have "The Cloud" that enables systems, applications, and data to be reached from anywhere using almost any type of device. All of these devices require security to ensure they are only being used for the purposed in which they are intended.

The $120 billion cybersecurity industry is standing guard while our society becomes ever more dependent on technology is with its multitude of products and services. This industry is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years.

Businesses today are looking for qualified cybersecurity professionals. In this lesson, you’ll understand why security is so important and how you can play a part.

1.2.3 The Security Mindset
---------------------------------------
Summary
Cybersecurity is an art as well as a science. It’s the ability to understand the past and current trends to better understand the future. It’s about being curious, tenacious, and always learning, which means developing your security mindset.

In March 2008, security pundit Bruce Schneier blogged about the security mindset. Security professionals look at the world differently. When they walk into a store, airport, or museum, they naturally look for security guards and cameras. It’s the same on computers where they look for vulnerabilities and error messages to better understand how the technology works. They try to figure out how security can be bypassed to better understand how it can be strengthened.

In developing your intuition about cybersecurity, consider three mantras.

* Trust, but verify.
* Stop.Think.Connect.
* If you see something, say something.

Throughout this course and your life, continually be building your security mindset and developing your security intuition.

Reflect on Your Security Mindset
In the box below, consider how you are building your security mindset and intuition. What steps will you take to be cyber-smart? Use the three sayings to develop your answer.

learn , experience , do, rinse and repeat.

Things to think about
A good security mindset is about being curious about how things work and why they work the way they do. It's about being tenacious in our problem-solving. And it's about helping others being cyber safe.

1.2.9 Cybersecurity Careers
---------------------------------------
Note: in the pie chart in the video, the age should be 35-44 for 33%

Summary
There are many opportunities in the world of cybersecurity. It’s not only about the sheer number of jobs, but also the types and breadth of work available.

Currently, we are experiencing a phenomenon known as the Cybersecurity Skills Gap. This means the number of open jobs is way beyond the number of cybersecurity people available to fill them.

According to a recent survey in Security Magazine, 76% of organizations of all types and sizes are and have been struggling to find quality cybersecurity talent. ISACA, an international professional association focused on IT audit, governance, risk, and security has a similar survey. Their State of Cybersecurity 2020 report echoes the challenges of hiring cybersecurity positions. Additionally, two-thirds of respondents say it’s difficult to retain cybersecurity talent.

To build a career in cybersecurity or technology takes three things:

* Experience
* Education
* Certifications

Also needed to fill a cybersecurity role are

* Technical Skills
* Functional Knowledge
* Personal abilities

The Further Research area contains links for you to explore including a wiki from Peerlyst with articles on starting or expanding a cybersecurity career.

1.2.13 Security Principles
---------------------------------------
Security Principles
This video explains a set of security principles that are the framework for all security programs. These basic ideas are not specific to cybersecurity or IT and are used to structure how we protect our technologies.

Saltzer and Schroeder’s Design Principles published in their paper “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems” in 1975:

* Economy of mechanism
* Fail-safe defaults
* Complete mediation
* Open design
* Separation of privilege
* Least privilege
* Least common mechanism
* User-friendly interface

(Source: http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/index.html)

Economy of Mechanism means to keep things small and simple.

* Bigger is not better. It just means there’s more to protect. And complexity is an enemy of security.
* Complex systems are harder to defend because you need to understand all of the ways to access it and how processes can be broken to allow unauthorized activities.

To fail safe means to anticipate how things can go wrong and to ensure when it does, things are in a safe state. This safe state should be the default, not an exception. To do this, you need to know how something may fail and plan for that failure, which is failing smart.

Least Privilege is a concept dealing with Access Control. It means having the minimum privileges or permissions needed to do a job. Nothing more, nothing less. Too much and you could be blamed if there are problems.

For choke points and defense in depth

* Choke Point - only one way in or out
* Defense in Depth - layers of security

The CIA of security is Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability*.*

* Confidentiality means limiting who can see and read sensitive information.
* Integrity means limiting who can change sensitive information.
* Availability means ensuring the information is there when we need it.

Quiz Question
Match the example with the security concept.

Security Principle     Example

Economy of Mechanism   Keep It Short and Simple

Fail Safe              Unlock doors with a power outage

Least Privilege        General user (non admin) rights

Chokepoint             Drawbridge

Confidentiality        Keeping secrets

1.2.17 Security Best Practice Exercise
---------------------------------------
Security Best Practice Exercise #1 - Password Managers
Passwords are a poor way to prove a user's identity. They are easily shared, written down, and leaked. Plus, there are so many to remember! Password managers are encrypted vaults that hold your passwords so you don't need to memorize them or write them down. Besides keeping your identity, credentials, and sensitive data safe, a password manager can generate strong, unique passwords to ensure you aren't reusing them across your devices and services. This way, you can use a much longer, complex, and ultimately more secure password. An additional benefit with many password managers is that you can use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with them. Common password management applications include:

* LastPass
* KeePass
* 1Password
* Dashlane

Some of these are free and some may require a paid subscription.

Reflect on Password Managers
For this exercise, select a password manager either from the list above or from your own experience or research. Install the application and use it for a few of your accounts. Answer the following:

* Which password manager did (or do) you use?
* How does it help you as a general use? Does it make it easier for you to use other applications that require a user-id and password?
* Would you recommend it to others? Why or why not?
revelation
i dont have to remember all passwors for different applications, revelation does it for me
yes, i would recommend for all.

Things to think about
The intent of this exercise is to give you the opportunity to test a password manager to understand how it fits as a part of security best practices. Example answers:

I use LastPass to store IDs and passwords used for my education and training websites.
With this, I don't need to memorize my password and it's much easier to login to the stored websites. I can also use a much longer and stronger password.
I found LastPass very easy to initially configure and use. It automatically asks if I want to store a new account in its password vault/database.

Security Best Practice Exercise #2 - Checking for Viruses
Viruses, worms, trojan horse applications, ransomware, spyware, etc continue to haunt us and be a threat vector according to the Verizon Data Breach Report from a previous lesson. Anti-Virus or EndPoint Protection Programs aren't perfect and may miss zero-day threats.
Virustotal.com inspects uploaded files and website URLs with over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blacklisting services. It's free to end-users for non-commercial use. See their How It Works webpage for more information about it.

Reflect on Virus Scanning
Now it's your turn to use two VirusTotal features: file scanning and URL scanning.

Step 1: Go to the VirusTotal Website: https://www.virustotal.com/
Step 2: To check a file for viruses against the VirusTotal database, select the File option, and upload a file of your choice to see if it is safe from known viruses. Record your observations. You can answer these questions about your observations: Were any viruses detected in the file you selected? How many virus scanning programs were used?
Step 3: Repeat the process above using the URL Scanning tool.

Your reflection
no 73

Things to think about
The intent of this exercise is for you to explore VirusTotal.com and see how it can supplement a device's anti-virus and end-point protection applications.
Hopefully, the file you uploaded on the site had no viruses detected. You can see the 70+ different programs it uses to detect potential malware in both files and website URLs.
