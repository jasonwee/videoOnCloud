Always restate the question
Make sure you are answering the right question by saying in your own words what is being asked.

Ask additional clarifying questions
State any key assumptions you are making and ask follow up questions to clarify.

There are many prioritization models out there (e.g. the RICE model). Find one or two that resonate with you and be prepared to use them, since prioritization questions are quite common in Product Manager interviews.

Key Takeaways
Consider the following best practices that Nargis discussed in the previous video:

Start with user needs
No matter the type of problem, keep the needs of your users first.

Structure your approach
This is applicable to every type of problem. Providing structure upfront in the problem demonstrates organized thinking and is important to keeping your answer focused.

Gain familiarity of common technical solutions
It’s valuable to have a basic architectural understanding of some well known products -- for example Google Search and Facebook Newsfeed.

Understand the differences between mobile and desktop applications
In preparation for your interview, review the key differences and considerations when building an application for mobile vs desktop. This is particularly important if the company you are interviewing with has a mobile product.

Study the technology of the company you are interviewing with.
Prior to the interview, gain a basic familiarity with the company’s key technology. This preparation will not only help you answer questions you are asked, but can also inspire questions for you to ask the interviewer.
