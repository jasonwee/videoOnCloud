Key Takeaways
Growth Product Manager is a relatively new role within the Product Management domain. Some aspects of a Growth Product Manager role that are unique and exciting:

Tinkering is key: Growth Product Managers are constantly trying new experiments, testing new ideas, and doing many of these at once.
New experiments more than new features: Growth Product Managers focus on how to get more customers to use existing features. A major challenge is identifying and experimenting new ways for customer adoption.
Quantity, not just quality: Sometimes in Product Management, the focus will be on building a small set of very high quality features to address customer needs. As a Growth Product Manager, quantity is critical -- you need to test a lot of ideas at once.
