2.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
Introduction

Summary

Welcome to the Cloud Native Fundamentals course!

Before building an application, it is common to go through a design phase to identify the main requirements and structure of an application. In correlation with the available resources, a team will choose the most suitable project architecture.

In the industry, usually, the two main approaches that are usually referenced are monoliths and microservices. In this lesson, we will explore each architectural model and the implied trade-offs. As well, we will cover good development practices to be considered if an application is targeted for containerization. These practices are valid for both monolith and microservice architectures.

In this lesson, we will cover:

* Monoliths and Microservices
* Trade-offs for Monoliths and Microservices
* Practices for Application Development



2.2 Design Considerations for Cloud-Native Applications
---------------------------------------
Summary
When building an application it is important to allocate time for context discovery. This includes listing all necessary functionalities of the application and enumerating any resources that can enable its buildout. This phase sets the fundamentals of the project. If properly implemented, it can enable the creation of services that are scalable, resilient, and extensible.

The first step in the context discovery process is to list the functional requirements, or what application capabilities should deliver to the end-users. For example, a good starting point is to expand on the following:

* Stakeholders
* Functionalities
* End users
* Input and output process
* Engineering teams

The second step is to enumerate the available resources that facilitates the implementation of the project. For example, a good starting point is to list available:

* Engineering resources
* Financial resources
* Timeframes
* Internal knowledge

Having a good understanding of functional requirements and available resources can lead to a simpler choice between monolithic and microservice-based architectures.



2.3 Monoliths and Microservices
---------------------------------------
Summary
Prior to an organization delivers a product, the engineering team needs to decide on the most suitable application architecture. In most of the cases 2 distinct models are referenced: monoliths and microservices. Regardless of the adopted structure, the main goal is to design an application that delivers value to customers and can be easily adjusted to accommodate new functionalities.

Also, each architecture encapsulates the 3 main tiers of an application:

* UI (User Interface) - handles HTTP requests from the users and returns a response
* Business logic - contained the code that provides a service to the users
* Data layer - implements access and storage of data objects

Monoliths
In a monolithic architecture, application tiers can be described as:

* part of the same unit
* managed in a single repository
* sharing existing resources (e.g. CPU and memory)
* developed in one programming language
* released using a single binary

A booking application referencing the monolithic architecture

Imagine a team develops a booking application using a monolithic approach. In this case, the UI is the website that the user interacts with. The business logic contains the code that provides the booking functionalities, such as search, booking, payment, and so on. These are written using one programming language (e.g. Java or Go) and stored in a single repository. The data layer contains functions that store and retrieve customer data. All of these components are managed as a unit, and the release is done using a single binary.

Microservices
In a microservice architecture, application tiers are managed independently, as different units. Each unit has the following characteristics:

* managed in a separate repository
* own allocated resources (e.g. CPU and memory)
* well-defined API (Application Programming Interface) for connection to other units
* implemented using the programming language of choice
* released using its own binary

A booking application referencing the microservice architecture

Now, let's imagine the team develops a booking application using a microservice approach.

In this case, the UI remains the website that the user interacts with. However, the business logic is split into smaller, independent units, such as login, payment, confirmation, and many more. These units are stored in separate repositories and are written using the programming language of choice (e.g. Go for the payment service and Python for login service). To interact with other services, each unit exposes an API. And lastly, the data layer contains functions that store and retrieve customer and order data. As expected, each unit is released using its own binary.

New terms
* Monolith: application design where all application tiers are managed as a single unit
* Microservice: application design where application tiers are managed as independent, smaller units

2.5 Trade-offs for Monoliths and Microservices
---------------------------------------

Trade-offs for Monoliths and Microservices

Summary

An application can be designed using both, monolithic or microservice-based architectures. So far, we have looked at how the structure of an application is contoured by functional requirements and available resources. However, each architecture has a set of trade-offs, that need to be thoroughly examined before deciding on the final structure of the application.

These trade-offs cover development complexity, scalability, time to deploy, flexibility, operational cost, and reliability. Let's examine each trade-off in more detail!


Summary

Development Complexity
Development complexity represents the effort required to deploy and manage an application.
* Monoliths - one programming language; one repository; enables sequential development
* Microservice - multiple programming languages; multiple repositories; enables concurrent development

Scalability
Scalability captures how an application is able to scale up and down, based on the incoming traffic.
* Monoliths - replication of the entire stack; hence it's heavy on resource consumption
* Microservice - replication of a single unit, providing on-demand consumption of resources

Time to Deploy
Time to deploy encapsulates the build of a delivery pipeline that is used to ship features.
* Monoliths - one delivery pipeline that deploys the entire stack; more risk with each deployment leading to a lower velocity rate
* Microservice - multiple delivery pipelines that deploy separate units; less risk with each deployment leading to a higher feature development rate

Flexibility
Flexibility implies the ability to adapt to new technologies and introduce new functionalities.
* Monoliths - low rate, since the entire application stack might need restructuring to incorporate new functionalities
* Microservice - high rate, since changing an independent unit is straightforward

Operational Cost
Operational cost represents the cost of necessary resources to release a product.
* Monoliths - low initial cost, since one code base and one pipeline should be managed. However, the cost increases exponentially when the application needs to operate at scale.
* Microservice - high initial cost, since multiple repositories and pipelines require management. However, at scale, the cost remains proportional to the consumed resources at that point in time.

Reliability
Reliability captures practices for an application to recover from failure and tools to monitor an application.
* Monoliths - in a failure scenario, the entire stack needs to be recovered. Also, the visibility into each functionality is low, since all the logs and metrics are aggregated together.
* Microservice - in a failure scenario, only the failed unit needs to be recovered. Also, there is high visibility into the logs and metrics for each unit.

Each application architecture has a set of trade-offs that need to be considered at the genesis of a project. But more importantly, it is paramount to understand how the application will be maintained in the future e.g. at scale, under load, supporting multiple releases a day, etc.

There is no "golden path" to design a product, but a good understanding of the trade-offs will provide a clear project roadmap. Regardless if a monolith or microservice architecture is chosen, as long as the project is coupled with an efficient delivery pipeline, the ability to adopt new technologies, and easily add features, the path to could-native deployment is certain.



2.6 Quizzes: Trade-offs for Monoliths and Microservices
---------------------------------------
> QUIZ QUESTION
> Which considerations does each trade-off cover?
continous project maintenance based on user feedback
development complexity

>   QUIZ QUESTION
> Imagine a product that supports the handling of data with multiple databases. For example, a research team that benchmarks and evaluates a new database for their product very often. However, once a database is evaluated, they do not verify how quickly the database can be recovered in case of failure.
> Which trade-off should the engineering team consider?
> Choose the best one option.
flexibility


> QUIZ QUESTION
> Due to low customer satisfaction, an engineering team wants to optimize and refactor their product based on customer feedback. So far, the feedback highlights that the application errors when a transaction occurs or when a customer tries to access their account. What actions should the engineering team take to improve the reliability of the application?
Choose the best two options.
* improve the log messages for each service, so it's esier to identify failures
* check if the metrics are representative of the actual CPU and memory consumption for each service



2.7 Exercise: Trade-offs for Monoliths and Microservices
---------------------------------------
Exercise: Trade-offs for Monoliths and Microservices
Outline the architecture of an application
From the early stages of application development, it is fundamental to understand the requirements and available resources. Overall, these will contour the architecture decisions.

Imagine this scenario: you are part of the team that needs to outline the structure of a centralized system to book flight tickets for different airlines. At this stage, the clients require the front-end(UI), payment, and customer functionalities to be designed. Also, these are the individual requirements of each airline:

Airline A - payments should be allowed only through PayPal
Airline B - payments should be disabled (bookings will be exclusively in person or via telephone)
Airline C - payments should be allowed to use PayPal and debit cards
Using the above requirements, outline the application architecture. Also, elaborate your reasoning on choosing a microservice or monolith based approach.

> Application Design
> Input your answer
i would choose microservice arch given such scenario.

for front end (UI), receive different payment requests from different airline.. 

for business logic, orientate based on different airline requirements and should the trafffic increase, replicate that single unit only.

for backend storage, can store different type of data based on different airline data modelling.



2.8 Solution: Monoliths and Microservices
---------------------------------------
Solution: Monoliths and Microservices
Summary
Given the scenario, it is paramount to choose an architecture that would be replicable and scalable. For example, if thousands of customers access the payment service in the same timeframe, then this particular service should be scaled up. In a monolith architecture, scaling up creates a replica of everything, including front-end and customer services, in addition to the payment service. This will also consume more resources on the platform, such as CPU and memory, and takes longer to spin up.

On the other side, a microservice is a lightweight component that requires fewer resources (CPU and memory) and less time for provisioning.

For this example, a microservice-based architecture is chosen, based on considerations that the application is a central booking system for multiple airlines, that implies a high load. The main components are:

* Front-end - entry-point for the user, where they will choose their airline of choice
* Customer - requires a database (MySQL or Mongo) to store the customer details
* Payments - to implement PayPal and Debit based operations

ight booking application using microservice architecture

Additionally, the "payments" microservice is capable of handling multiple payment systems. Interaction with the PayPal interface and management of debit card APIs are fundamentally different. The "payments" component is a monolith that can be divided into multiple parts.

Payments:

* PayPal - handling all the PayPal payments
* Debit - handling all the debit card payments

Payment service being split into PayPal and Debit microservices

2.9 Best Practices For Application Deployment
---------------------------------------
Summary
Using the knowledge acquired so far, you should be able to choose the most suitable architecture for an application, based on requirements, available resources, and involved trade-offs. The next stage consists of building the application. Regardless of the chosen architecture, a set of good development practices can be applied to improve the application lifecycle throughout the release and maintenance phases. Adopting these practices increases resiliency, lowers the time to recovery, and provides transparency of how a service handles incoming requests.

These practices are focused on health checks, metrics, logs, tracing, and resource consumption.

Health Checks
Health checks are implemented to showcase the status of an application. These checks report if an application is running and meets the expected behavior to serve incoming traffic. Usually, health checks are represented by an HTTP endpoint such as /healthz or /status. These endpoints return an HTTP response showcasing if the application is healthy or in an error state.

Metrics
Metrics are necessary to quantify the performance of the application. To fully understand how a service handles requests, it is mandatory to collect statistics on how the service operates. For example, the number of active users, handled requests, or the number of logins. Additionally, it is paramount to gather statistics on resources that the application requires to be fully operational. For example, the amount of CPU, memory, and network throughput. Usually, the collection of metrics are returned via an HTTP endpoint such as /metrics, which contains the internal metrics such as the number of active users, consumed CPU, network throughput, etc.

Logs
Log aggregation provides valuable insights into what operations a service is performing at a point in time. It is the nucleus of any troubleshooting and debugging process. For example, it is essential to record if a user logged in successfully into a service, or encountered an error while performing a payment.

Usually, the logs are collected from STDOUT (standard out) and STDERR (standard error) through a passive logging mechanism. This means that any output or errors from the application are sent to the shell. Subsequently, these are collected by a logging tool, such as Fluentd or Splunk, and stored in backend storage. However, the application can send the logs directly to the backend storage. In this case, an active logging technique is used, as the log transmission is handled directly by the application, without a logging tool required.

There are multiple logging levels that can be attributed to an operation. Some of the most widely used are:
* DEBUG - record fine-grained events of application processes
* INFO - provide coarse-grained information about an operation
* WARN - records a potential issue with the service
* ERROR - notifies an error has been encountered, however, the application is still running
* FATAL - represents a critical situation, when the application is not operational

As well, it is common practice to associate each log line with a timestamp, that will exactly record when an operation was invoked.

Tracing
Tracing is capable of creating a full picture of how different services are invoked to fulfill a single request. Usually, tracing is integrated through a library at the application layer, where the developer can record when a particular service is invoked. These records for individual services are defined as spans. A collection of spans define a trace that recreates the entire lifecycle of a request.

Resource Consumption
Resource consumption encapsulates the resources an application requires to be fully operational. This usually refers to the amount of CPU and memory that is consumed by an application during its execution. Additionally, it is beneficial to benchmark the network throughput, or how many requests can an application handle concurrently. Having awareness of resource boundaries is essential to ensure that the application is up and running 24/7.

2.11 Exercise: Endpoints for Application Status
---------------------------------------
Exercise: Endpoints for Application Status
This exercise aims to extend a Python Flask web application with status and metrics endpoints.

Environment Setup
Let's first set up your environment to extend a Python Flask application:

1. Check the Python installation and clone the course exercise repository using Git, as:
# Check the Python version installed
python3 --version
# Python 3.8.x
# Assuming you have already cloned the course repo as
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1.git
cd nd064_course_1
# Optional - Create a virtual Python environment
python3 -m venv .myvenv
source .myvenv/bin/activate
# Move to the exercise folder
cd exercises/python-helloworld

2. Install the dependencies and run the app using python or flask run commands:

# Assuming you are in the exercises/python-helloworld/ directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Use either of the methods below. Method 1 will use the Development mode, whereas the Method 2 will use the Production mode.
# Dev mode means you need not restart the server after making any edits.
# Method 1 to run the app - Recommended
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
# Running the app in development mode will show a traceback both in console and the browser when there is an error.
# Method 2 to run the app
python3 app.py

3. Access the "Hello World" application on your local browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ . Note that the Python Flask uses port 5000 by default.

Run the initial Flask application

Viewing the output at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

4. Open your editor of choice (VS Code IDE or vim) to edit the Hello World application. In most cases, usiing MS Code is convenient to use, as:
# Assuming you are in the exercises/python-helloworld/ directory
# Open VS Code
code .

Once all the pre-requisites are completed, you can get started on developing endpoints to describe the application state.

Exercise
Extend the Python Flask application with /status and /metrics endpoints, considering the following requirements:

* Both endpoints should return an HTTP 200 status code.
* Both endpoints should return a JSON response e.g.
  {"user": "admin"}
  Note: the JSON response can be hardcoded at this stage.
* The /status endpoint should return a response similar to this example:
  @app.route('/status')
  def status():
  response = app.response_class(
          response=json.dumps({"result":"OK - healthy"}),
          status=200,
          mimetype='application/json'
  )
  return response
* The /metrics endpoint should return a response similar to this example:
  @app.route('/metrics')
  def metrics():
  response = app.response_class(
          response=json.dumps({"status":"success","code":0,"data":{"UserCount":140,"UserCountActive":23}}),
          status=200,
          mimetype='application/json'
  )
  return response

Tips: If you get stuck, feel free to check the solution video where detailed operations are demonstrated.



2.12 Solution: Endpoints for Application Status
---------------------------------------
The following snippet showcases an example of a Python Flask application, with /metrics, /status and main page (/) endpoints:

from flask import Flask
from flask import json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/status')
def status():
    response = app.response_class(
            response=json.dumps({"result":"OK - healthy"}),
            status=200,
            mimetype='application/json'
    )

    return response

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    response = app.response_class(
            response=json.dumps({"status":"success","code":0,"data":{"UserCount":140,"UserCountActive":23}}),
            status=200,
            mimetype='application/json'
    )

    return response

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')



2.13 Exercise: Application Logging
---------------------------------------
Exercise: Application Logging
Logging is a core factor in increasing the visibility and transparency of an application. When in troubleshooting or debugging scenarios, it is paramount to pin-point the functionality that impacted the service. This exercise will focus on bringing the logging capabilities to an application.

Environment Setup
This exercise is in continuation from the previous exercise. For the environment setup, follow the instructions in the previous exercise.

Exercise Instructions
At this stage, you have extended the Hello World application to handle different endpoints. Once an endpoint is reached, a log line should be recorded showcasing this operation.

In this exercise, you need to further develop the Hello World application collect logs, with the following requirements:

* Import the logging framework.
  import logging
* For each endpoint, log the information, for example:
  @app.route("/")
  def hello():
  # Logging a CUSTOM message 
  app.logger.info('Main request successfull')
  return "Hello World!"

  Logging can be done at various levels (depth), such as, capturing all event details or just the errors. The app.logger.info() above is capturing the INFO level details. Following are the in-built log-levels:

  Log-Level	 Description
  Debugi     Logs the information necessary for debugging.
  Info       Used for logging the status messages or any desirable field value
  Warning    Used for logging potentially unexpected/dangerous situations
  Error      Used for logging minor Error events
  Critical   Used for logging very severe Error events that might lead the application to collapse.

* We want the log "message" above along with the timestamp and requested endpoint to be recorded in a text file. For this purpose, add the following configuration to the main section of app.py as:

  if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Stream logs to a file, and set the default log level to DEBUG
  logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
  app.run(host='0.0.0.0')

The logging.basicConfig() statement above will create a app.py file in the present working directory and append all log messages to it. You can expect the log message for individual endpoint to be similar as:

"{{TIMESTAMP}}, {{ ENDPOINT_NAME}} {Status code}"
# Examples
[24/Jan/2022 16:37:04] "GET /metrics HTTP/1.1" 200
[24/Jan/2022 16:43:26] "GET /notfound HTTP/1.1" 404

Refer to the logging Python module for more details.

* For this exercise, enable the Python logs for all individual endpoints. You can play around with Log levels other than the app.logger.info('message') shown above.

Tip: If you get stuck, feel free to check the solution video where detailed operations are demonstrated.



2.14 Solution : Application Logging
---------------------------------------

Summary
The solution can be found in this directory:

# Move to the solution folder to view the solution
cd nd064_course_1/solutions/python-helloworld

The following snippet showcases how logging would be implemented for each endpoint:

from flask import Flask
from flask import json
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/status')
def healthcheck():
    response = app.response_class(
            response=json.dumps({"result":"OK - healthy"}),
            status=200,
            mimetype='application/json'
    )

    ## log line
    app.logger.info('Status request successfull')
    return response

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    response = app.response_class(
            response=json.dumps({"status":"success","code":0,"data":{"UserCount":140,"UserCountActive":23}}),
            status=200,
            mimetype='application/json'
    )

    ## log line
    app.logger.info('Metrics request successfull')
    return response

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    ## log line
    app.logger.info('Main request successfull')

    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":

    ## stream logs to app.log file
    logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log',level=logging.DEBUG)

    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')


> Reflection on Design Consideration for an Application
> What are your opinions on the core considerations for choosing a microservice vs monolith methodology?
Cost, Development Complexity, Scalability and Flexibility are the core considerations. As given limited time, these are core considerations before any other considerations can be consider in the future time. It is imperative to get start a project, a minimal and viable product/service. 

Things to think about
Contouring the architecture for an application is not a simple task. It requires a thorough understanding of the requirements and available resources.



2.15 Edge Case: Amorphous Applications
---------------------------------------
In the previous sections, we have explored how to choose a suitable architecture for an application and how to apply some of the best development practices. However, this is only the start of the application lifecycle. After an engineering team has successfully released a product, with both monolith and microservices, the next phase in the application lifecycle is maintenance. In this edge case, we will explore commonly used maintenance operations after a product is released.

Summary
Throughout the maintenance stage, the application structure and functionalities can change, and this is expected! The architecture of an application is not static, it is amorphous and in constant movement. This represents the organic growth of a product that is responsive to customer feedback and new emerging technologies.

Both monolith and microservice-based applications transition in the maintenance phase after the production release. When considering adding new functionalities or incorporating new tools, it is always beneficial to focus on extensibility rather than flexibility. Generally speaking, it is more efficient to manage multiple services with a well-defined and simple functionality (as in the case of microservices), rather than add more abstraction layers to support new services (as we’ve seen with the monoliths). However, to have a well-structured maintenance phase, it is essential to understand the reasons an architecture is chosen for an application and involved trade-offs.

Some of the most encountered operations in the maintenance phase are listed below:

* A split operation - is applied if a service covers too many functionalities and it's complex to manage. Having smaller, manageable units is preferred in this context.
* A merge operation- is applied if units are too granular or perform closely interlinked operations, and it provides a development advantage to merge these together. For example, merging 2 separate services for log output and log format in a single service.
* A replace operation - is adopted when a more efficient implementation is identified for a service. For example, rewriting a Java service in Go, to optimize the overall execution time.
* A stale operation - is performed for services that are no longer providing any business value, and should be archived or deprecated. For example, services that were used to perform a one-off migration process.

Performing any of these operations increases the longevity and continuity of a project. Overall, the end goal is to ensure the application is providing value to customers and is easy to manage by the engineering team. But more importantly, it can be observed that the structure of a project is not static. It amorphous and it evolves based on new requirements and customer feedback.
