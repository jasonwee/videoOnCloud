1.1 Welcome to the Course
---------------------------------------



1.2 Course Structure
---------------------------------------
Course Structure
In this course you will learn how to deploy TensorFlow lite models on Android, iOS, and IoT devices. This program is divided into 4 main lessons:

Lesson 2 – Introduction to TensorFlow Lite

Lesson 3 – TF Lite on Android

Lesson 4 – TF Lite on iOS with Swift

Lesson 5 – TF Lite on IoT

Lesson 2 is aimed for all type of developers so that they learn how TensorFlow Lite works under the hood. We recommend everybody goes through lesson 2 regardless of their platform. The next 3 lessons (lessons 3, 4, and 5) are designed to be completely independent of each other and therefore, they all share similar sections that cover the same topics. Consequently, if you are an Android developer you can take lessons 2 and 3; if you are an iOS developer you can jump straight to lesson 4 after taking lesson 2; and if you are interested in deploying your models on the Raspberry Pi (or other IoT devices) you can jump straight to lesson 5 after taking lesson 2.

We hope you enjoy this course!



1.3 Prerequisites
---------------------------------------
Prerequisites
This course is aimed at software developers that are comfortable programming in Python, Swift, Android, and on Linux platforms, depending on which platform you plan to deploy on.

We also expect that you have some experience working with TensorFlow, TensorFlow Datasets, Android Studio, and Machine Learning (including transfer learning and convolutional neural networks).



1.4 Apps
---------------------------------------
The Apps
In this course you will deploy TF Lite models in various apps including:

Cats vs. Dogs: An app that classifies images of cats and dogs.
Image Classification: An app that continuously classifies whatever it sees from your device's back camera.
Objection Detection: An app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and classes) in the frames seen by your device's back camera.
Speech Recognition: An app that recognizes the words you say.
You can find all the apps for this course in this Zip file. Once you unzip the file you will find the folders containing the corresponding apps for each lesson. We will also provide links to the individual apps later in each lesson.
