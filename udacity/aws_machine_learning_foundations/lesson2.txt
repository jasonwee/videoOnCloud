2.2 What is Machine Learning?
---------------------------------------
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique and a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

In supervised learning, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
In unsupervised learning, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
In reinforcement learning, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning. We will dive deep into this in the next lesson.

2.3 components of machine learning
---------------------------------------
Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:

A machine learning model
A model training algorithm
A model inference algorithm

A model is an extremely generic program(or block of code), made specific by the data used to train it. It is used to solve different problems.

Which of the following are the primary components used in machine learning?
A machine learning model
A model training algorithm
A model inference algorithm

ï¿¼

A model is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.

Model training algorithms work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.

Model inference is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.

2.5 Introduction to Machine Learning Steps
---------------------------------------
step one   : define the problem
step two   : build the dataset
step three : train the model
step four  : evaluate the model
step five  : inference (use the model)


2.6 Define the problem
---------------------------------------
A task is supervised if you are using labeled data. We use the term labeled to refer to data that already contains the solutions, called labels.

A task is considered to be unsupervised if you are using unlabeled data. This means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.




In supervised learning, there are two main identifiers you will see in machine learning:

A categorical label has a discrete set of possible values. In a machine learning problem in which you want to identify the type of flower based on a picture, you would train your model using images that have been labeled with the categories of flower you would want to identify. Furthermore, when you work with categorical labels, you often carry out classification tasks*, which are part of the supervised learning family.
A continuous (regression) label does not have a discrete set of possible values, which often means you are working with numerical data. In the snow cone sales example, we are trying to predict the number* of snow cones sold. Here, our label is a number that could, in theory, be any value.


answer:
supervised Learning
unsupervised learning


Terminology
Clustering. Unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
A categorical label has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is a cat" and "is not a cat."
A continuous (regression) label does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means possibly an unlimited number of possibilities.
Discrete: A term taken from statistics referring to an outcome taking on only a finite number of values (such as days of the week).
A label refers to data that already contains the solution.
Using unlabeled data means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.


2.7 Quiz: Define the Problem

Correct! Both answers chosen here involve trying to predict some unknown continuous attribute about your data.

Remember: Classification tasks involve predicting some unknown categorical attribute about your data.

Regression tasks involve predicting some unknown continuous attribute about your data.

Clustering tasks involve exploring how your data might be grouped together
