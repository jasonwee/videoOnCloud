Prerequisites
Everyone is welcome!
All learners are welcome to take the foundations course, but familiarity with basic mathematical concepts such as calculation, average, variance, and beginning level programming (preferably Python) is recommended to fully engage in all of the coursework. If you want to brush up on your Python skills, we encourage you to review our free Introduction to Python course.

Learn More About Machine Learning
We encourage you to dive deeper in to machine learning with our Intro to Machine Learning and Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch courses.

Both courses are FREE and will help you be even better prepared to take the end-of-course assessment.

You may also find our Version Control with Git course helpful. It is also offered for FREE.

Course Overview
Lesson 2: Introduction to Machine Learning – In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, including the process steps of solving machine learning problems, and explore several examples.
Lesson 3: Machine Learning with AWS – In this lesson, you will learn about advanced machine learning techniques such as generative AI, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. You will also learn how to train these models with AWS AI/ML services.
Lesson 4: Software Engineering Practices, part 1 – In this lesson, you will learn how to write well-documented, modularized code.
Lesson 5: Software Engineering Practices, part 2 – In this lesson, you will learn how to test your code and log best practices.
Lesson 6: Object-Oriented Programming – In this lesson, you will learn about this programming style and prepare to write your own Python package.

By the end of the course, you will be able to...
Explain machine learning and the types of questions machine learning can help to solve.
Explain what machine learning solutions AWS offers and how AWS AI devices put machine learning in the hands of every developer.
Apply software engineering principles of modular code, code efficiency, refactoring, documentation, and version control to data science.
Apply software engineering principles of testing code, logging, and conducting code reviews to data science.
Implement the basic principles of object-oriented programming to build a Python package.
