4.1 Introduction
---------------------------------------
Welcome To Software Engineering Practices, Part I
In this lesson, you'll learn about the following software engineering practices and how they apply in data science.

Writing clean and modular code
Writing efficient code
Code refactoring
Adding meaningful documentation
Using version control
In the lesson following this one (part 2), you'll also learn about the following software engineering practices:

Testing
Logging
Code reviews



4.2 Clean and Modular Code
---------------------------------------
Production code: Software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note that this is different from production-quality code, which describes code that meets expectations for production in reliability, efficiency, and other aspects. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.

Clean code: Code that is readable, simple, and concise. Clean production-quality code is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.

Modular code: Code that is logically broken up into functions and modules. Modular production-quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.

Module: A file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.


q1
Which of the following describes code that is clean? Select all the answers that apply.
simple
readable
concise


q2
Making your code modular makes it easier to do which of the following things? There may be more than one correct answer.
reuse your code
write lesscode
read your code
collaborate on code



4.3 Recfactoring Code
---------------------------------------
Refactoring: Restructuring your code to improve its internal structure without changing its external functionality. This gives you a chance to clean and modularize your program after you've got it working.

Since it isn't easy to write your best code while you're still trying to just get it working, allocating time to do this is essential to producing high-quality code. Despite the initial time and effort required, this really pays off by speeding up your development time in the long run.

You become a much stronger programmer when you're constantly looking to improve your code. The more you refactor, the easier it will be to structure and write good code the first time.



4.4 Writing Clean Code
---------------------------------------
Writing clean code: Meaningful names
Use meaningful names.

Be descriptive and imply type: For booleans, you can prefix with is_ or has_ to make it clear it is a condition. You can also use parts of speech to imply types, like using verbs for functions and nouns for variables.

Be consistent but clearly differentiate: age_list and age is easier to differentiate than ages and age.

Avoid abbreviations and single letters: You can determine when to make these exceptions based on the audience for your code. If you work with other data scientists, certain variables may be common knowledge. While if you work with full stack engineers, it might be necessary to provide more descriptive names in these cases as well. (Exceptions include counters and common math variables.)

Long names aren't the same as descriptive names: You should be descriptive, but only with relevant information. For example, good function names describe what they do well without including details about implementation or highly specific uses.

Try testing how effective your names are by asking a fellow programmer to guess the purpose of a function or variable based on its name, without looking at your code. Coming up with meaningful names often requires effort to get right.

Writing clean code: Nice whitespace
Use whitespace properly.

Organize your code with consistent indentation: the standard is to use four spaces for each indent. You can make this a default in your text editor.

Separate sections with blank lines to keep your code well organized and readable.

Try to limit your lines to around 79 characters, which is the guideline given in the PEP 8 style guide. In many good text editors, there is a setting to display a subtle line that indicates where the 79 character limit is.

For more guidelines, check out the code layout section of PEP 8 in the following notes.



4.5 Quiz: Clean Code
---------------------------------------
Imagine you are writing a program that executes a number of tasks and categorizes each task based on its execution time. Below is a small snippet of this program. Which of the following naming changes could make this code cleaner? There may be more than one correct answer.

t = end_time - start  # compute execution time
c = category(t)  # get category of task
print('Task Duration: {} seconds, Category: {}'.format(t, c)

Rename the variable start to start_time to make it consistent with end_time.
Rename the variable t to execution_time to make it more descriptive.
Rename the function category to categorize_task to match the part of speech.
Rename the variable c to category to make it more descriptive.



Quiz: Buying stocks
Imagine you analyzed several stocks and calculated the ideal price, or limit price, at which you'd want to buy each stock. You write a program to iterate through your stocks and buy it if the current price is below or equal to the limit price you computed. Otherwise, you put it on a watchlist. Below are three ways of writing this code. Which of the following is the most clean?

# Choice A
stock_limit_prices = {'LUX': 62.48, 'AAPL': 127.67, 'NVDA': 161.24}
for stock_ticker, stock_limit_price in buy_prices.items():
    if stock_limit_price <= get_current_stock_price(ticker):
        buy_stock(ticker)
    else:
        watchlist_stock(ticker)
# Choice B
prices = {'LUX': 62.48, 'AAPL': 127.67, 'NVDA': 161.24}
for ticker, price in prices.items():
    if price <= current_price(ticker):
        buy(ticker)
    else:
        watchlist(ticker)
# Choice C
limit_prices = {'LUX': 62.48, 'AAPL': 127.67, 'NVDA': 161.24}
for ticker, limit in limit_prices.items():
    if limit <= get_current_price(ticker):
        buy(ticker)
    else:
        watchlist(ticker)

Which code is most clean?

Choice C



4.6 Writing Modular Code
---------------------------------------
Writing Modular Code
Follow the tips below to write modular code.

Tip: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Don't repeat yourself! Modularization allows you to reuse parts of your code. Generalize and consolidate repeated code in functions or loops.

Tip: Abstract out logic to improve readability
Abstracting out code into a function not only makes it less repetitive, but also improves readability with descriptive function names. Although your code can become more readable when you abstract out logic into functions, it is possible to over-engineer this and have way too many modules, so use your judgement.

Tip: Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc.)
There are trade-offs to having function calls instead of inline logic. If you have broken up your code into an unnecessary amount of functions and modules, you'll have to jump around everywhere if you want to view the implementation details for something that may be too small to be worth it. Creating more modules doesn't necessarily result in effective modularization.

Tip: Functions should do one thing
Each function you write should be focused on doing one thing. If a function is doing multiple things, it becomes more difficult to generalize and reuse. Generally, if there's an "and" in your function name, consider refactoring.

Tip: Arbitrary variable names can be more effective in certain functions
Arbitrary variable names in general functions can actually make the code more readable.

Tip: Try to use fewer than three arguments per function
Try to use no more than three arguments when possible. This is not a hard rule and there are times when it is more appropriate to use many parameters. But in many cases, it's more effective to use fewer arguments. Remember we are modularizing to simplify our code and make it more efficient. If your function has a lot of parameters, you may want to rethink how you are splitting this up.



4.7 Exercise: Refactoring – Wine quality
---------------------------------------
Exercise: Refactoring – Wine quality
In this exercise, you'll refactor code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.

Download the notebook file refactor_wine_quality.ipynb and the dataset winequality-red.csv. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.

Supporting Materials

4.8 Solution: Refactoring – Wine quality
--------------------------------------
The following code shows the solution code. You can download the solution notebook file that contains the solution code.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
df.head()

## Renaming Columns

df.columns = [label.replace(' ', '_') for label in df.columns]
df.head()

## Analyzing Features

def numeric_to_buckets(df, column_name):
    median = df[column_name].median()
    for i, val in enumerate(df[column_name]):
        if val >= median:
            df.loc[i, column_name] = 'high'
        else:
            df.loc[i, column_name] = 'low'

for feature in df.columns[:-1]:
    numeric_to_buckets(df, feature)
    print(df.groupby(feature).quality.mean(), '\n')



4.9 Efficient Code
---------------------------------------
Efficient Code
Knowing how to write code that runs efficiently is another essential skill in software development. Optimizing code to be more efficient can mean making it:

Execute faster
Take up less space in memory/storage
The project on which you're working determines which of these is more important to optimize for your company or product. When you're performing lots of different transformations on large amounts of data, this can make orders of magnitudes of difference in performance.


4.10 Optimizing – Common Books
---------------------------------------



4.11 Exercise: Optimizing - Common books
---------------------------------------
Exercise: Optimizing – Common books
We provide the code your coworker wrote to find the common book IDs in books_published_last_two_years.txt and all_coding_books.txt to obtain a list of recent coding books. Can you optimize it?

Download the notebook file optimizing_code_common_books.ipynb and the text files. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.

You can also take a look at the example notebook optimizing_code_common_books_example.ipynb to help you finish the exercise.

4.12 Solution: Optimizing - Common books
---------------------------------------
Solution: Optimizing - Common books
The following code shows the solution code. You can download the solution notebook file that contains the solution code.

import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

with open('books_published_last_two_years.txt') as f:
    recent_books = f.read().split('\n')

with open('all_coding_books.txt') as f:
    coding_books = f.read().split('\n')

start = time.time()
recent_coding_books = []

for book in recent_books:
    if book in coding_books:
        recent_coding_books.append(book)

print(len(recent_coding_books))
print('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))

## Tip #1: Use vector operations over loops when possible

start = time.time()
recent_coding_books = np.intersect1d(recent_books, coding_books)
print(len(recent_coding_books))
print('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))

## Tip #2: Know your data structures and which methods are faster

start = time.time()
recent_coding_books = set(recent_books).intersection(coding_books)
print(len(recent_coding_books))
print('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))


4.13 Exercise: Optimizing – holiday Gifts
---------------------------------------
Exercise: Optimizing - Holiday Gifts
In the last example, you learned that using vectorized operations and more efficient data structures can optimize your code. Let's use these tips for one more exercise.

Your online gift store has one million users that each listed a gift on a wishlist. You have the prices for each of these gifts stored in gift_costs.txt. For the holidays, you're going to give each customer their wishlist gift for free if the cost is under $25. Now, you want to calculate the total cost of all gifts under $25 to see how much you'd spend on free gifts.

Download the notebook file optimizing_code_holiday_gifts.ipynb and the gift_costs.txt file. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.

4.15 Documentation
---------------------------------------
Documentation
Documentation: Additional text or illustrated information that comes with or is embedded in the code of software.
Documentation is helpful for clarifying complex parts of code, making your code easier to navigate, and quickly conveying how and why different components of your program are used.
Several types of documentation can be added at different levels of your program:
Inline comments - line level
Docstrings - module and function level
Project documentation - project level



4.16 Inline Comments
---------------------------------------
Inline Comments
Inline comments are text following hash symbols throughout your code. They are used to explain parts of your code, and really help future contributors understand your work.
Comments often document the major steps of complex code. Readers may not have to understand the code to follow what it does if the comments explain it. However, others would argue that this is using comments to justify bad code, and that if code requires comments to follow, it is a sign refactoring is needed.
Comments are valuable for explaining where code cannot. For example, the history behind why a certain method was implemented a specific way. Sometimes an unconventional or seemingly arbitrary approach may be applied because of some obscure external variable causing side effects. These things are difficult to explain with code.



4.17 Docstrings
---------------------------------------
Docstrings
Docstring, or documentation strings, are valuable pieces of documentation that explain the functionality of any function or module in your code. Ideally, each of your functions should always have a docstring.

Docstrings are surrounded by triple quotes. The first line of the docstring is a brief explanation of the function's purpose.

One-line docstring
def population_density(population, land_area):
    """Calculate the population density of an area."""
    return population / land_area
If you think that the function is complicated enough to warrant a longer description, you can add a more thorough paragraph after the one-line summary.

Multi-line docstring
def population_density(population, land_area):
    """Calculate the population density of an area.

    Args:
    population: int. The population of the area
    land_area: int or float. This function is unit-agnostic, if you pass in values in terms of square km or square miles the function will return a density in those units.

    Returns:
    population_density: population/land_area. The population density of a
    particular area.
    """
    return population / land_area

The next element of a docstring is an explanation of the function's arguments. Here, you list the arguments, state their purpose, and state what types the arguments should be. Finally, it is common to provide some description of the output of the function. Every piece of the docstring is optional; however, doc strings are a part of good coding practice.

4.18 Project Documentation
---------------------------------------
Project Documentation
Project documentation is essential for getting others to understand why and how your code is relevant to them, whether they are potentials users of your project or developers who may contribute to your code. A great first step in project documentation is your README file. It will often be the first interaction most users will have with your project.

Whether it's an application or a package, your project should absolutely come with a README file. At a minimum, this should explain what it does, list its dependencies, and provide sufficiently detailed instructions on how to use it. Make it as simple as possible for others to understand the purpose of your project and quickly get something working.

Translating all your ideas and thoughts formally on paper can be a little difficult, but you'll get better over time, and doing so makes a significant difference in helping others realize the value of your project. Writing this documentation can also help you improve the design of your code, as you're forced to think through your design decisions more thoroughly. It also helps future contributors to follow your original intentions.

There is a full Udacity course on this topic.

Here are a few READMEs from some popular projects:

Bootstrap
Scikit-learn
Stack Overflow Blog


4.19 Quiz: Documentation

4.20 Version Control in Data Science
---------------------------------------




4.21 Scenario #1
---------------------------------------
Scenario #1
Let's walk through the Git commands that go along with each step in the scenario you just observed in the video.

Step 1: You have a local version of this repository on your laptop, and to get the latest stable version, you pull from the develop branch.
Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

Pull the latest changes in the develop branch
git pull

Step 2: When you start working on this demographic feature, you create a new branch called demographic, and start working on your code in this branch.
Create and switch to a new branch called demographic from the develop branch
git checkout -b demographic

Work on this new feature and commit as you go
git commit -m 'added gender recommendations'
git commit -m 'added location specific recommendations'
...

Step 3: However, in the middle of your work, you need to work on another feature. So you commit your changes on this demographic branch, and switch back to the develop branch.
Commit your changes before switching
git commit -m 'refactored demographic gender and location recommendations '

Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

Step 4: From this stable develop branch, you create another branch for a new feature called friend_groups.
Create and switch to a new branch called friend_groups from the develop branch
git checkout -b friend_groups

Step 5: After you finish your work on the friend_groups branch, you commit your changes, switch back to the development branch, merge it back to the develop branch, and push this to the remote repository’s develop branch.
Commit your changes before switching
git commit -m 'finalized friend_groups recommendations '

Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

Merge the friend_groups branch into the develop branch
git merge --no-ff friends_groups

Push to the remote repository
git push origin develop

Step 6: Now, you can switch back to the demographic branch to continue your progress on that feature.



4.22 Scenario #2
---------------------------------------
Scenario #2
Let's walk through the Git commands that go along with each step in the scenario you just observed in the video.

Step 1: You check your commit history, seeing messages about the changes you made and how well the code performed.
View the log history
git log

Step 2: The model at this commit seemed to score the highest, so you decide to take a look.
Check out a commit
git checkout bc90f2cbc9dc4e802b46e7a153aa106dc9a88560

After inspecting your code, you realize what modifications made it perform well, and use those for your model.

Step 3: Now, you're confident merging your changes back into the development branch and pushing the updated recommendation engine.
Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop


4.23 Scenario #3
---------------------------------------
Scenario #3
Let's walk through the Git commands that go along with each step in the scenario you just observed in the video.

Step 1: Andrew commits his changes to the documentation branch, switches to the development branch, and pulls down the latest changes from the cloud on this development branch, including the change I merged previously for the friends group feature.
Commit the changes on the documentation branch
git commit -m "standardized all docstrings in process.py"

Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

Pull the latest changes on the develop branch down
git pull

Step 2: Andrew merges his documentation branch into the develop branch on his local repository, and then pushes his changes up to update the develop branch on the remote repository.
Merge the documentation branch into the develop branch
git merge --no-ff documentation

Push the changes up to the remote repository
git push origin develop

Step 3: After the team reviews your work and Andrew's work, they merge the updates from the development branch into the master branch. Then, they push the changes to the master branch on the remote repository. These changes are now in production.
Merge the develop branch into the master branch
git merge --no-ff develop

Push the changes up to the remote repository
git push origin master

Resources
Read this great article on a successful Git branching strategy.

Note on merge conflicts
For the most part, Git makes merging changes between branches really simple. However, there are some cases where Git can become confused about how to combine two changes, and asks you for help. This is called a merge conflict.

Mostly commonly, this happens when two branches modify the same file.

For example, in this situation, let’s say you deleted a line that Andrew modified on his branch. Git wouldn’t know whether to delete the line or modify it. You need to tell Git which change to take, and some tools even allow you to edit the change manually. If it isn’t straightforward, you may have to consult with the developer of the other branch to handle a merge conflict.

To learn more about merge conflicts and methods to handle them, see About merge conflicts.


4.24 Model Versioning
---------------------------------------
Model versioning
In the previous example, you may have noticed that each commit was documented with a score for that model. This is one simple way to help you keep track of model versions. Version control in data science can be tricky, because there are many pieces involved that can be hard to track, such as large amounts of data, model versions, seeds, and hyperparameters.

The following resources offer useful methods and tools for managing model versions and large amounts of data. These are here for you to explore, but are not necessary to know now as you start your journey as a data scientist. On the job, you’ll always be learning new skills, and many of them will be specific to the processes set in your company.
