Interest Rate and Discount Rate are terms that refer to essentially the same quantity, but are used to distinguish two slightly different use cases:

Interest Rate is used with a given Present Value, to figure out what the Future Value would be.
Discount Rate is used when we have a known or desired Future Value, and want to compute the corresponding Present Value.
For instance, in this case we want to sum up all future dividends - equal to a constant ($1 or FV) every year.
