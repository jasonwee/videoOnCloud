4.1 Course introduction
---------------------------------------
Introduction
Welcome to Understanding Google Cloud Security and Operations! In this module, you'll meet the instructor, learn about the course content, and how to get started.

Learning Objectives:

Gain an overview of the course structure and content breakdown.
Obtain a copy of the student slides.



4.2 Module 1 overview
---------------------------------------
Module 1: Financial Governance in the Cloud
Organizations that adopt cloud technology will inevitably need to fundamentally change some of their business operations. The first of these is about financial governance. This module explains the core challenges organizations face when managing cloud costs and proposes a solution through three lenses: people, process, and technology. It also explains how to think about the total cost of ownership when using cloud services, before unpacking core Google Cloud cost management concepts. It ends by describing some best practices for effective cloud cost management.

Learning Objectives:

* Explain how to think about total cost of ownership (TCO) in the cloud.
* Describe best practices for effective cloud cost management.

4.7 Module 2 overview
---------------------------------------

Module 2: Security in the Cloud
This module covers the second way that businesses need to change their operations to work effectivey inn the cloud: security. It examines a new cloud-first security model and explains how it differs from traditional on-premises IT security models. The module starts by defining a few fundamental terms related to security in the cloud. Then, it considers today’s top cybersecurity challenges and the most common threats to data privacy and security. After that, it uses the Shared Responsibility Model to illustrate how organizations can maintain data security and compliance on an ongoing basis. Finally, it looks at how Google Cloud equips organizations to control and manage access to data and resources through Cloud Identity.

Learning Objectives:

Identify today's top cybersecurity challenges and threats to data privacy.
Explain what is meant by a ‘Shared Responsibility Model’ and how customers can use Google Cloud tools to implement their chosen security policies.

4.15 Module 3 overview
---------------------------------------
Module 3: Monitoring Cloud IT Services and Operations
The third operational shift that businesses must make in the cloud is re-evaluating how they monitor their IT services. This module starts by exploring IT operational challenges—specifically, how IT teams are traditionally structured, and why that structure prevents organizations from quickly delivering updates to services or fresh customer experiences. Next, it defines what DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering are, before using them as a framework for IT operational changes. Finally, the module examines Google Cloud resource monitoring tools and how they help organizations maintain control and visibility of their cloud environment.

Learning Objectives:

Define monitoring, logging, and observability within the context of cloud operations.
Identify the Google Cloud resource monitoring and maintenance tools.
Differentiate DevOps from SRE.
