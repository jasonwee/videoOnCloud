C++ Comments
Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:


// This is a comment
cout << "Hello World!";


This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:


cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment


Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:

/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
cout << "Hello World!";
