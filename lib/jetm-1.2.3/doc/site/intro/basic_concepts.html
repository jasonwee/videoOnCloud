    <h3>JETM Basic concepts</h3>

    <p>
      Consider a Java&trade; application that has or potentially may have performance problems. What do you do?
    </p>

    <p>Most likely you will go ahead and <b>profile the application</b>
      using a Java Profiler or just <b>log execution times</b> to a logging framework.
      Both strategies will hopefully give you enough information to understand
      what is really going wrong in your application.
    </p>

    <p>However these two strategies do have their drawbacks.</p>
    <h4>The issues</h4>

    <p>
      Even though a Java&trade; Profiler offers a detailed inside-view to your application
      you sometimes just can't use it. This is because typically a profiler makes use of the
      Java&trade; Virtual Machine Profiling Interface (JVMPI) or Java&trade; Virtual Machine Tool Interface
      (JVMTI) to collect fine-grained details such as object and
      memory allocations, execution paths and garbage collector behavior. The usage of these interfaces
      and the related profiler extensions usually <i>add some overhead</i> to executions times and thus
      may <i>slow down an application</i> to a point where it is impossible to be used in a production
      environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an alternative to profiling and often as part of the runtime monitoring
      process application developers tend to log execution times to log files. Depending on the size
      of the application and the developer team this tends to be a major nightmare in terms <i>data formatting,
      quality and consistency</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>The idea</h4>

    <p>
      While leaving the in-depth application performance analysis in the hands of professional
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Java+Profiler+YourKit+JProfiler&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"
         target="_blank">Java Profilers</a>
      there is often a need to monitor an application under production load or even transparently during development
      and testing. Therefore it is necessary to provide means to collect statistics similar to
      the ones of Java Profilers without their side effects. From a high level perspective JETM gives you exactly
      this ability with minimal (but existing) impact on application performance and minimal requirements for test
      setup and maintenance.
    </p>
    <h4>How does it work?</h4>

    <p>
      All you need to do is to mark code fragments as <i>to be measured</i> and associate a name
      with it. These so called <b>EtmPoints</b> or <b>MeasurementPoints</b> are the foundation of the Java&trade;
      Execution Time Measurement Library.
    </p>

      For a quick overview see <a href="one_minute_tutorial.html">one minute tutorial</a>. Of course JETM targets a bit
      more
      than that, see <a href="advanced_concepts.html">advanced concepts</a> for further details.
