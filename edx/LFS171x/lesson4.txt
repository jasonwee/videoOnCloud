Introduction

The Hyperledger frameworks which we examined in the previous chapter are used to build blockchains and distributed ledgers. The Hyperledger tools, which we will look at next, are auxiliary softwares used for things like deploying and maintaining blockchains, examining the data on the ledgers, as well as tools to design, prototype, and extend blockchain networks.



Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Understand the role of Hyperledger tools.
Get a high-level understanding of the Hyperledger tools (as of November 2020): Hyperledger Avalon, Hyperledger Cactus, Hyperledger Caliper, Hyperledger Cello, Hyperledger Explorer.



Hyperledger Avalon

Hyperledger Avalon is a ledger independent implementation of the Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification published by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). It joined the Hyperledger Incubator in October of 2019, bringing together sponsorship from Intel, iExec Blockchain Tech, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu, BGI, Chainlink, Consensys, EEA, Espeo, IBM, Kaleido, Microsoft, Banco Santander, Wipro, Oracle, and Monax. It aims to enable the secure movement of blockchain processing off the main chain to dedicated computing resources. Avalon is designed to help developers gain the benefits of computational trust and mitigate its drawbacks. It is released under the Apache License Version 2.0.

Hyperledger Avalon:

Enables developers to accelerate throughput and improve data privacy
The initial implementation of Hyperledger Avalon uses Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
Uses the Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification as a starting point to apply a consistent and compatible approach to all supported blockchains. 

You can learn more about Hyperledger Avalon from Eugene (Yevgeniy) Yarmosh's An Introduction to Hyperledger Avalon presentation.



Hyperledger Cactus

Hyperledger Cactus is an open source project jointly contributed by Accenture and Fujitsu; it joined the Hyperledger Greenhouse in May 2020. Formerly known as the Blockchain Integration Framework, this blockchain integration tool aims to provide decentralized, secure and adaptable integration between blockchain networks. Developers are currently working on refactoring the Hyperledger Cactus architecture to ensure it will enable plug-in based collaborative development, thus increasing the breadth of use cases and ledgers supported. Hyperledger Cactus is licensed under an Apache License Version 2.0.

To learn more about Hyperledger Cactus, you can watch Peter Somogyvari's Hyperledger Cactus - A Framework for Integrating Distributed Ledgers presentation.

Hyperledger Caliper

Currently in incubation, Hyperledger Caliper was initially contributed in 2018 by developers from Huawei, Hyperchain, Oracle, Bitwise, Soramitsu, IBM and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. It references the definitions, metrics and terminology defined by the Performance and Scalability Working Group. Some of the project's key characteristics are:

Unified blockchain benchmark framework
Commonly accepted definition of performance indicators
Commonly accepted benchmark cases.
As of November 2020, it supports the following blockchain solutions: Hyperledger Besu, Hyperledger Burrow, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, FISCO BCOS, Hyperledger Iroha and Hyperledger Sawtooth.

Hyperledger Caliper is a blockchain benchmark tool, which allows users to measure the performance of a specific blockchain implementation with a set of predefined use cases.



Hyperledger Cello

Hyperledger Cello is a blockchain module toolkit helping businesses use and manage blockchains in a more efficient way. Particularly for lean businesses and small enterprises, who want to reduce or eliminate the effort required in creating, managing, and terminating blockchains, Hyperledger Cello allows blockchains deployment to the cloud. Operators can create and manage such blockchains through a dashboard, and users (typically, chaincode developers) can obtain a blockchain instance immediately.

Currently in Incubation, "Cello aims to bring the on-demand 'as-a-service' deployment model to the blockchain ecosystem", thus helping in furthering the development and deployment of Hyperledger's frameworks. Hyperledger Cello was initially contributed by IBM, with sponsors from Soramitsu, Huawei, and Intel (2017).

Application developers and system administrators using Cello can provision and maintain Hyperledger networks. For instance, you can create a group of distributed ledger networks in virtual clouds known as 'container clusters', and then, manage and monitor those networks with a configurable dashboard. Additionally, you can build a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform.

Some key features are:

Deploy, manage and operate blockchains efficiently and automatically
Support customized blockchain requests (support for Hyperledger Fabric)
Support various infrastructures (baremetal, VM platforms, container cloud)
Support advanced operational analytics for system status and ledger behavior

Hyperledger Explorer

Hyperledger Explorer is a simple, but powerful open source tool for visualizing blockchain operations. It is the first tool to examine permissioned ledgers, allowing anyone to explore the distributed ledger projects being created by Hyperledger's members from the inside, without compromising their privacy. Currently in Incubation, the project was contributed by DTCC, Intel, and IBM in 2016.

Designed to create a user-friendly web application, Hyperledger Explorer can view, invoke, deploy, or query:

Blocks
Transactions and associated data
Network information (name, status, list of nodes)
Smart contracts (chain codes and transaction families)
Other relevant information stored in the ledger.

The ability to visualize data is of critical importance, in order to extract business value from it. Hyperledger Explorer provides this much needed functionality. Key components include a web server, a web UI, web sockets, a database, a security repository, and a blockchain implementation.

Hyperledger Explorer supports Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Iroha.
