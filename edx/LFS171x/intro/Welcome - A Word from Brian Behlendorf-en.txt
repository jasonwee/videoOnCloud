Hi, I'm Brian Behlendorf. I'm Executive Director of Hyperledger, a collaborative project hosted at the Linux Foundation.
I want to welcome you to the first ever training course for Hyperledger and our related technology projects.
Hyperledger is really the first series of projects focused on enterprise blockchain applications.
And that means using distributed ledger technologies in a permissioned setting,
it means using smart contracts to automate various business processes,
and it means building a really exciting new world of secure, trustworthy information systems and automation of business processes.
In this course, you'll learn about these different projects.
This course is designed for people on the full spectrum, from working on purely as a software developer,
all the way to those who just really want a business level understanding of what these technologies can accomplish,
and what are the kinds of use cases that you might apply this to.
So, this is really designed for the full breadth of those technologies
