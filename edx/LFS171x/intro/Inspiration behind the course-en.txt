What is the inspiration behind this course, and what do you hope students will gain from the course?
This course is really designed for technologists who want to better understand how the different projects at Hyperledger work, right,
at a kind of an overview level, right, understand the differences between them, start to understand what they can do with them,
but it's also designed for those who might have been a technologist in the past and now think a little bit... spend a little more time focusing on the business applications of blockchain technology,
to help understand what are the kinds of use cases that would be appropriate to apply these technologies to.
So, it's really intended to give that kind of overview, as well as to talk a little bit about what do we mean when we say blockchains for business, right,
how does is that different from the cryptocurrency landscape, right, what are the mechanics of these, what are consensus mechanisms, what is a smart contract, right?
