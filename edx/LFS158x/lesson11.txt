11.2 Deploying a Stand-Alone Application
---------------------------------------

If a container in the Pod is running, but the application running inside this container is not responding to our requests, then that container is of no use to us. This kind of situation can occur, for example, due to application deadlock or memory pressure. In such a case, it is recommended to restart the container to make the application available.

Rather than restarting it manually, we can use a Liveness Probe. Liveness probe checks on an application's health, and if the health check fails, kubelet restarts the affected container automatically.

Liveness Probes can be set by defining:

Liveness command
Liveness HTTP request
TCP Liveness Probe.



In the following example, the kubelet sends the HTTP GET request to the /healthz endpoint of the application, on port 8080. If that returns a failure, then the kubelet will restart the affected container; otherwise, it would consider the application to be alive.

livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 8080
        httpHeaders:
        - name: X-Custom-Header
          value: Awesome
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      periodSeconds: 3



With TCP Liveness Probe, the kubelet attempts to open the TCP Socket to the container which is running the application. If it succeeds, the application is considered healthy, otherwise the kubelet would mark it as unhealthy and restart the affected container.

livenessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      periodSeconds: 20



Sometimes, applications have to meet certain conditions before they can serve traffic. These conditions include ensuring that the depending service is ready, or acknowledging that a large dataset needs to be loaded, etc. In such cases, we use Readiness Probes and wait for a certain condition to occur. Only then, the application can serve traffic.

A Pod with containers that do not report ready status will not receive traffic from Kubernetes Services.

readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - cat
    - /tmp/healthy
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5

Readiness Probes are configured similarly to Liveness Probes. Their configuration also remains the same.

Please review the Kubernetes documentation for more details.
